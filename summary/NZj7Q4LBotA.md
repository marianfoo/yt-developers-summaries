# Summary of "Back to basics with SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) - part 6"

In this session of Live Coding with DJ Adams, the focus is on the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) with discussions on coding techniques, specifically related to OData operations. Viewers can learn various aspects of SAP CAP along with real-time coding practices and community interaction. 

- **Technical Topics Discussed:**
  - OData operations including create, read, update, and delete (CRUD)
  - Use of GUIDs and best practices for key assignment
  - In-memory versus persistent database handling in CAP
  - SQL Lite setup for persistence in CAP applications

DJ delves deeply into the significance of using GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers) for entity keys to ensure better scalability in applications. The discussion also encompasses how these GUIDs are generated, managed, and their relevance in OData contexts. During coding demonstrations, DJ transitions from using simple integer-based keys to implementing CUIDs (Canonical Unique Identifiers) and explores the implications of this change through practical examples. He highlights the interaction of CAP with SQL Lite databases and how to deploy data models effectively.

In a lighter moment, DJ shares a fun anecdote about experiencing a hailstorm during his morning run, adding a personal touch to the session. 

The chat is active, with viewers engaging by asking questions, sharing insights, and providing feedback on coding practices. DJ acknowledges their contributions, fostering a collaborative atmosphere throughout the stream.
