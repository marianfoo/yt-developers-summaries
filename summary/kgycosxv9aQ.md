# Summary of Live Coding Session with DJ Adams: SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) - Part 7

In this session, DJ Adams explores the SAP Cloud Application Programming (CAP) Model, focusing on creating associations between book and author entities while interacting with viewers. Participants can learn about the technical aspects of CAP, OData navigation properties, and association types.

- **Key Technical Topics Discussed:**
  - Introduction to SAP CAP and its framework.
  - Use of OData for defining navigation properties.
  - Creating consistent relationships between data entities.
  - Definition and use of code lists and associations in the CDS (Core Data Services) model.
  - Insights into the latest SAP developer news and challenges.

Throughout the session, DJ delves deep into SAP CAP, demonstrating the creation of a `Country of Birth` association for the authors. He explains the need for such associations to promote data integrity, maintainability, and consistency. By utilizing existing common entities, he illustrates how to avoid inconsistencies during data entry. The discussion covers practical examples of implementing associations while using SQL databases, explaining how foreign keys work within this framework and how they become a benefit when modeled through CAP.

Beyond technical topics, DJ shares a brief personal anecdote about enjoying morning runs by the canal, which adds a personal touch to the coding session. 

Viewers actively engaged in the chat, asking questions about coding practices, sharing insights on the technical topics, and providing helpful feedback. The interactive environment fostered a collaborative learning experience, with the chat serving as a space for discussion and clarifications.
