5m39s: morning uh from to you in stutgart oh my
5m43s: goodness me those are um I don&amp;#39;t know
5m45s: whether you&amp;#39;ve typed those in sort of
5m47s: manually but I can see open curly
5m48s: brackets lowercase I close curly
5m50s: brackets at the start of that and then
5m52s: open curly brackets Escape YY 100p so
5m56s: maybe there&amp;#39;s a control codes that I
5m57s: might see if I flip to let me flip to um
6m0s: uh no they they still look like that in
6m2s: the chat as well so I have no idea
6m3s: what&amp;#39;s going on anyway welcome everybody
6m6s: let me flip to um the main scene just a
6m10s: reminder did I put this in the chat I
6m12s: can&amp;#39;t even remember you know it&amp;#39;s like
6m14s: two minutes ago code connect week uh no
6m17s: that&amp;#39;s right here we go so let me let me
6m18s: add that URL in the chat as well um so
6m22s: basically I&amp;#39;ve just pushed a couple of
6m24s: updates to bring this repo basically our
6m27s: working repo as we sort of explore
6m29s: basics of cap um so it&amp;#39;s up to date as
6m32s: of you know yesterday so at the end of
6m34s: episode 7 um I had some bits and pieces
6m37s: in there in services for example what
6m39s: was that end of episode seven what was
6m40s: the services difference um oh that&amp;#39;s
6m43s: right yeah we added that service banana
6m45s: because I think um somebody asked a
6m46s: great question right at the end and I
6m48s: was trying to explain about services and
6m50s: projections oh that&amp;#39;s right it was to do
6m51s: with views wasn&amp;#39;t it so anyway if you
6m54s: want the most upto-date version of what
6m57s: we all have here in my vs code it&amp;#39;s
7m0s: there in the um in the uh cap B2B uh
7m4s: repo which you can clonee now just a
7m6s: couple of things to point out I&amp;#39;ll put
7m7s: the links in the chat
7m10s: already and of course um the links will

8m1s: coffee uh and then I have uh I brew a an
8m5s: arrow press type coffee to have here but
8m8s: I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve only had one but I feel as
8m9s: though I&amp;#39;ve had about 10 coffees I don&amp;#39;t
8m11s: know what what&amp;#39;s going on I don&amp;#39;t know
8m13s: so that&amp;#39;s why my words are coming out

8m20s: there&amp;#39;s Shila fantastic hello Shila um
8m22s: so check out that the link is in the uh
8m25s: chat as well and maybe most Timely
8m30s: and there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s an item on this in
8m31s: the news as well this week but code
8m33s: connect the the number one developer
8m37s: event this summer for sap developers
8m38s: code connect um it&amp;#39;s the first week in
8m41s: June but the most important part is that
8m43s: registration opens for these three
8m47s: consecutive one day conferences recap UI

9m1s: C so check it out so there we go and
9m4s: that&amp;#39;s that
9m5s: now a bit of a da da moment we&amp;#39;re going
9m9s: to start off with because we had a
9m10s: discussion last week didn&amp;#39;t we on um
9m13s: reuse types common reuse types cap where
9m15s: are we uh no cap um cap docs uh let me
9m21s: just search in there um reuse
9m25s: types reuse type there we go reuse types
9m28s: so we looked at um type country okay
9m30s: reuse types and somebody very correctly
9m33s: said why don&amp;#39;t we have any data wouldn&amp;#39;t
9m36s: it be nice if we had some data and I had
9m38s: a complete brain fail one of many um
9m42s: where I I was say oh yeah maybe we could
9m44s: have a sort of CDs Plugin or some
9m45s: nonsense like that and blah blah blah
9m47s: blah blah there is
9m50s: already I realized I thought about it
9m52s: after the live stream it&amp;#39;s always the
9m54s: case after the live stream finishes you
9m55s: know your brain sort of calms down and
9m57s: then you think oh of course that&amp;#39;s the
10m0s: answer so to the question is there any
10m5s: possibility of having some data for
10m8s: these common reuse types common reuse
10m10s: types being country currency language
10m13s: and time
10m14s: zone the answer is yes and the answer
10m19s: lies in a package called oh there we go
10m22s: uh CDs common
10m26s: content amazing who knew well I
10m28s: certainly didn&amp;#39;t not on the old um
10m30s: what&amp;#39;s happened to that
10m32s: um why is the read me uh not working
10m36s: there should be more in that read me
10m37s: basically I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on
10m38s: here let me refresh that oh there we go
10m41s: fine um brows a problem uh so there is
10m46s: common content gives you all the data
10m50s: for countries currencies language and
10m52s: time zones so what I did um as a as a as
10m56s: a punishment to myself and maybe a
10m58s: punishment to you because it to that be
10m59s: quite a Long blog post so
11m1s: sorry is I blogged about it um I blogged
11m5s: about I normally blog uh first of all on
11m7s: my own blog as in I publish a post on my
11m9s: own blog here ISO content for com and I
11m12s: prefer to read it here because I have
11m14s: better uh you know I can do better sort
11m16s: of um monospace formatting in the um in
11m19s: the paragraphs here um so there it is so
11m22s: there this this blog post takes you
11m25s: through and we&amp;#39;re going to go through it
11m26s: today as well takes you through how to
11m30s: get common reuse type data ISO data into
11m34s: your app okay into sorry into your
11m37s: service so check this out and if you&amp;#39;re
11m39s: over if I&amp;#39;ve also put the link to this
11m41s: one let me put the link there as well
11m42s: again um if you&amp;#39;re over on this one give
11m45s: it a Kudos give it a Kudos you know
11m48s: award points if helpful blah blah blah
11m50s: all that sort of stuff give it a quick
11m51s: Kudos anyway so I just noticed here
11m54s: something from Amar one question in cap
11m56s: binded exess UA service can we access
11m57s: all btp roles assigned are only specific
12m0s: to cap application created roles that&amp;#39;s
12m2s: a really good question I don&amp;#39;t know the
12m5s: answer to
12m6s: that let me find out unless anybody else
12m8s: on the chat knows the answer that&amp;#39;s a
12m10s: really good question so basically Amar
12m12s: is asking whether when we&amp;#39;ve
12m14s: got cap service bound to an instance of
12m19s: the exsu service can we access all the
12m22s: btp roles or only the ones specific to
12m24s: the cap application I think you should
12m26s: have access to all the rules um but
12m30s: I don&amp;#39;t know that&amp;#39;s a really good
12m31s: question Amar if nobody else can answer
12m33s: on the chat leave that with me and AJ
12m36s: and uh I don&amp;#39;t know who else from our
12m39s: team is on the uh on the chat right now
12m42s: on the live stream but me and AJ will
12m43s: have a talk about that next week or
12m44s: maybe the week after because I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m not
12m46s: around next week great question Amma
12m48s: thank you for asking that and keep all
12m50s: the questions coming like I always say I
12m51s: might not be able to answer the
12m52s: questions straight away but there we go
12m55s: right so we&amp;#39;re going to look at the iso
12m57s: content but first of all as we&amp;#39;re going
13m1s: to look at the iso content later in this
13m3s: episode but first of all we don&amp;#39;t need
13m5s: that um we don&amp;#39;t need that we don&amp;#39;t need
13m7s: that first of all let me sort of wind
13m11s: back to where we left off last week and
13m14s: it was here so we&amp;#39;ve
13m16s: got a Services file so we&amp;#39;re still
13m20s: deliberately sort of doing the
13m23s: nonconventional
13m24s: thing and not
13m27s: using um not dividing our stuff into the
13m32s: DB
13m34s: serve and app but you know apps to do
13m36s: with front end to the between the DB and
13m38s: serve between the persistance layer
13m40s: directory DB and the service layer
13m41s: directory serve we&amp;#39;re not doing that
13m43s: right now but I want to talk about that
13m45s: a little bit later as well so at the
13m47s: moment we&amp;#39;ve got this content our entire
13m51s: service is defined including the
13m53s: entities that that service exposes in
13m55s: this one file okay we also have this
13m58s: banana
14m0s: service um which I used just as an
14m2s: illustration right at the end of last
14m5s: episode um to demonstrate what you know
14m9s: a second service looked like in terms of
14m13s: the metadata but also in terms of the
14m15s: view that would be generated right at
14m17s: the persistence L the
14m19s: ddl but then right at the end you know I
14m22s: started it up here we go let me just uh
14m24s: uh uh clear let me run CDs watch and
14m28s: what happened if you remember when I
14m31s: started it up got my water here that cop
14m34s: made me really
14m39s: thirsty I started it up and I said oh
14m41s: yeah there we go oh there&amp;#39;s the two
14m43s: Services we&amp;#39;ve got the Bookshop service
14m46s: and the banana service we can see here
14m48s: serving Bookshop serving banana over
14m49s: here over here books as normal yeah fine
14m52s: thank you very much authors as normal
14m54s: yeah fine thank you very much and we&amp;#39;ve
14m55s: got that country of birth unor code we
14m58s: look a little bit more as to um what
15m0s: that what that property is shortly and
15m3s: also there&amp;#39;s a reference to that and an
15m5s: explanation of that in that blog post
15m6s: I&amp;#39;ve just posted to you as
15m8s: well fine but
15m11s: then I clicked on this didn&amp;#39;t I I
15m13s: selected this and it said
15m15s: bang error 500 so basically a server
15m19s: side error not anything that I&amp;#39;ve done
15m20s: in the request but something that um
15m24s: you&amp;#39;re welcome Amma you&amp;#39;re welcome thank
15m25s: you keep these questions coming if I
15m26s: can&amp;#39;t answer them I&amp;#39;ll hopefully go and
15m28s: find out and get back to you um and also
15m30s: we can all answer them together if we
15m32s: can&amp;#39;t right on the chat so I&amp;#39;m trying to
15m35s: access right now the entity set that
15m37s: sort of corresponds with this entity
15m39s: definition something which is just a
15m40s: prediction on books right so can anybody
15m42s: tell
15m43s: me why that was the case I think I did
15m46s: mention it last week but why do you
15m49s: think this doesn&amp;#39;t work let&amp;#39;s just read
15m52s: the error message why you while I give
15m54s: you a chance to for this 20 second delay
15m56s: catch up in the chat type thing so you
15m58s: can put something in the chat but let&amp;#39;s
16m0s: just read the error message no such
16m2s: table there&amp;#39;s a bit of a clue right
16m4s: banana uncore something in and then
16m7s: select Jason insert blah blah blah blah
16m9s: right so it&amp;#39;s doing something this
16m12s: select Jason insert from blah blah blah
16m14s: blah blah from Select something. Title
16m17s: from banana do something banor something
16m20s: now we
16m21s: know or we can guess at least that
16m25s: banana uncore something clearly is
16m28s: related ated to the something here
16m31s: inside of banana and remember as well
16m34s: you know we have this sort of name space
16m36s: entity name sort
16m39s: of con conjoined sort of uh two two
16m43s: strings with an underscore or sometimes
16m45s: with a DOT for example in our data
16m46s: directory Bookshop authors Bookshop do
16m48s: books you can see the the dash or the
16m49s: dot it doesn&amp;#39;t really
16m51s: matter so we can see that it&amp;#39;s looking
16m55s: for an
16m56s: artifact in the persistency
16m59s: layer called banana something and if we
17m2s: were to um oh oh oh I can see I can see
17m7s: um some somebody&amp;#39;s put something I&amp;#39;ll
17m8s: look at what&amp;#39;s in the chat in a minute
17m10s: because I think that might be um an
17m11s: answer to my question so we can see if
17m13s: we say SQL
17m15s: light SQL light three and then look at
17m18s: the um Bookshop books there we can see
17m24s: tables right if we have a look at that
17m27s: we can see that that&amp;#39;s where this
17m30s: underscore is used to sort of
17m33s: join the the the context name the name
17m37s: space right and the entity name now for
17m40s: example why is this Bookshop uncore
17m43s: authors
17m45s: because the author&amp;#39;s entity that&amp;#39;s what
17m48s: that thing is there is inside of this
17m51s: sort of well it&amp;#39;s not a name space
17m54s: explicitly it&amp;#39;s not context explicitly
17m57s: but it&amp;#39;s still you know the service
18m0s: within which it is defined still sort of
18m2s: in this particular case acts as like a
18m5s: namespace or a context so we get
18m7s: Bookshop uncore authors there right so P
18m11s: bean bean hello and welcome says CDs
18m16s: persistence skip now that&amp;#39;s a great
18m18s: guess it&amp;#39;s not quite what I was looking
18m20s: for but it&amp;#39;s a great guess because we&amp;#39;ve
18m21s: seen this annotation Haven we in the
18m23s: previous episode CDs persistance Skip
18m25s: and we&amp;#39;re going to be looking at CDs
18m26s: persistance skip um later on
18m29s: let me know in the chat if you&amp;#39;ve read
18m32s: through or attended I can see Matias
18m34s: there you&amp;#39;ve attended this Matias uh the
18m36s: one of our code jams on service
18m38s: integration with cap and we look at CDs
18m41s: persistence when you
18m44s: import a definition of an API let&amp;#39;s say
18m46s: an S4 Hanah Cloud API like you know API
18m49s: business partner for example and you
18m50s: import that with CDs import it will it
18m53s: will build the season the sort of
18m55s: internal representation like a CDs of uh
18m59s: internal representation for the API so
19m1s: that you can start using and referring
19m4s: to elements in that you know artifacts
19m7s: in that uh imported API definition from
19m10s: the S4 Hana system in your CDs right but
19m14s: the the the things that you refer to
19m16s: that the imported entities are all
19m18s: defined in the season with CDs
19m21s: persistence skip because you in your
19m24s: service don&amp;#39;t want to be storing that
19m26s: data that data is somewhere else in S4
19m28s: Hana right so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a common use
19m30s: of the CDs persistent skip annotation
19m33s: it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a good guess but it&amp;#39;s not
19m35s: quite the answer I was thinking of does
19m37s: anybody else know
19m38s: um also also also also we added this
19m43s: country of birth didn&amp;#39;t we and we also
19m47s: added these two stupid records for the
19m52s: country&amp;#39;s entity set right remember last
19m55s: week we said CDs add data and it
19m58s: generated for us these CSV files in DB
20m1s: data can we know why it&amp;#39;s DB
20m3s: data with the appropriate sort of header
20m6s: feel so we don&amp;#39;t have to work out what
20m8s: they are and then I typed in record this
20m11s: record and this record
20m13s: right but if we go back here when we
20m16s: look at
20m17s: countries oh I&amp;#39;m not running um there we
20m20s: go I&amp;#39;m not running CDs watch when we
20m22s: when I look try and look at
20m24s: countries when this starts up let me
20m26s: move that up a
20m27s: bit
20m29s: let&amp;#39;s just refresh that and countries
20m31s: it&amp;#39;s still empty where is it where&amp;#39;s
20m35s: that
20m36s: data hey Manu welcome and glad you have
20m39s: joined our session um it&amp;#39;s not just my
20m42s: session it&amp;#39;s our session right this this
20m44s: this hands- on Sab Dev back to basic
20m46s: series belongs to us and this is why the
20m47s: chat is so important this is why you&amp;#39;re
20m49s: so important right so Kiara says CDs
20m52s: deploy
20m53s: maybe very nicely put very subtly put as
20m56s: well I like I like the maybe yes and
20m58s: that&amp;#39;s exactly good morning Kevin Kevin
21m1s: in the house so kiar is spot on what we
21m5s: haven&amp;#39;t done is a CDS
21m8s: deploy now let&amp;#39;s have a look let me move
21m11s: that right up to top a minute to top um
21m15s: clear CDs
21m19s: deploy what is wrong my even my fingers
21m21s: are affected by the coffee CDs deoy
21m24s: d-el let&amp;#39;s just see what it says right
21m28s: de loys the given model to and I will
21m30s: also encourage you when you&amp;#39;re about to
21m33s: run a command or think you need to run a
21m34s: command just take a a couple of minutes
21m37s: to just do a dash dash help and have a
21m38s: look what that command is doing so you
21m40s: maybe better understand it maybe you
21m41s: understand it already but maybe you&amp;#39;ll
21m42s: spot something in the options that
21m44s: you&amp;#39;ve never seen before oh I remember
21m46s: that for the next time Kiara you yes I
21m48s: know I know you attended the codejam in
21m51s: Milan I think that was where I was
21m53s: wasn&amp;#39;t it
21m56s: yes so you&amp;#39;ll know CDs pist skip as well
21m59s: from that same code Jam excellent um
22m3s: uh yes so deploys the given model to
22m8s: database
22m9s: so let&amp;#39;s run see well
22m13s: actually before we run CDs
22m16s: deploy let&amp;#39;s go into um SQL light
22m20s: again and if we do a
22m23s: tables not tables sorry uh oh Dot
22m30s: tables we can see Bookshop authors books
22m32s: countries bookshops countries countries
22m35s: bookshops countries bookshops countries
22m36s: bookshops but we don&amp;#39;t see
22m40s: any thing relating
22m43s: to our banana service so we don&amp;#39;t see
22m47s: this banana uncore
22m49s: something that is in the error and
22m52s: that&amp;#39;s because as Kiara
22m55s: exactly what it impressia of course it
22m59s: was ah yes sorry yes it was in breia but
23m3s: I I had to fly to Milan and I stayed in
23m4s: a hotel in Milan that&amp;#39;s why I was
23m6s: thinking as I got a train from Milan to
23m8s: breia has anybody put in the chat if
23m12s: you&amp;#39;ve been to Milan and been to the the
23m14s: train station is the most magnificent
23m16s: building I&amp;#39;ve ever seen it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s
23m19s: Monumental it&amp;#39;s absolutely amazing yes
23m21s: of course so I I stayed in in Milan and
23m23s: I got the train to press here in the
23m25s: morning and back again yes sorry sorry
23m28s: of course it was
23m30s: breia anyway so um we don&amp;#39;t see this
23m33s: banana uncore something and that&amp;#39;s
23m34s: because we haven&amp;#39;t done CDs deploy but
23m36s: why do we need CDs
23m38s: deploy we haven&amp;#39;t needed to do a CDS
23m41s: deploy over the past previous six or
23m44s: seven episodes have we when we&amp;#39;ve added
23m46s: things to our CDs or added some
23m50s: data why do we need to do a CDS deploy
23m53s: now have a think about that and tell me
23m55s: in the
23m57s: chat
24m1s: oh that&amp;#39;s good that water is good I
24m3s: don&amp;#39;t why am I so
24m8s: thirsty I don&amp;#39;t
24m11s: know I give you a clue let&amp;#39;s have a look
24m13s: in package
24m17s: Jason remember a couple of episodes ago
24m20s: we added explicitly in the package Json
24m24s: Jason some configuration for our
24m27s: persistence Slayer now
24m31s: remember by the way I can feel myself
24m34s: going down another
24m35s: digression you know we&amp;#39;ve been working
24m37s: towards doing the associating books and
24m41s: authors for so long now and I feel
24m44s: really bad that we&amp;#39; still not got there
24m46s: we&amp;#39;re almost there we can almost touch
24m48s: it we can almost smell that association
24m51s: between books and authors coming down
24m52s: the line put in the chat whether you
24m55s: you&amp;#39;re okay with
24m56s: us you know getting there eventually we
24m59s: might get there today we might get there
25m1s: today right we&amp;#39;ve already seen an
25m3s: association where do we see that
25m4s: Association we saw that Association in
25m7s: the sap CDs common didn&amp;#39;t we um if we
25m9s: have a look in here we saw when we look
25m11s: oh yeah here we go um if we look at the
25m13s: services look at what country is right
25m15s: we saw country was an association we saw
25m18s: we you know we&amp;#39;re going to be doing
25m19s: something similar to this between books
25m20s: and
25m22s: authors but please put in the CH just to
25m24s: make me feel less guilty maybe so it&amp;#39;s a
25m27s: selfish request
25m29s: tell me or if you want to go straight to
25m31s: Association books and authors now let&amp;#39;s
25m33s: do that now but let let me know CU I
25m35s: think this discussion uh this digression
25m37s: is is fascinating let&amp;#39;s just kill that
25m41s: right and let&amp;#39;s just really quickly
25m44s: create CDs in it um temp right let&amp;#39;s
25m50s: create a
25m52s: new throwaway project let&amp;#39;s go into Temp
25m56s: and now if you see cdsn
25m59s: uh
26m0s: requires do in fact first of all let&amp;#39;s
26m3s: open package.json right this is this is
26m6s: like a the open sorry um code
26m8s: package.json right this is the raw
26m12s: completely fresh nothing done to at all
26m15s: package Json in a brand new cap nodejs
26m17s: project right no configuration no
26m19s: explicit cap configuration in there but
26m23s: now if we say CDs n and have a look at
26m26s: the requires we&amp;#39;ve done this before do
26m28s: it again requires.
26m31s: DB the
26m33s: default implicit configuration is to use
26m36s: SQL light but an inmemory SQL light
26m40s: database ah yes so Carson Carson says uh
26m43s: you make it to a persistent database
26m45s: from an inmemory exactly Caston thank
26m47s: you that is precisely what we did and
26m51s: what I was hoping somebody would say so
26m53s: caraston thank you Gregorian hello hello
26m55s: to you in Armenia amazing
26m58s: I did I worked for a long time um at a
27m1s: pharmaceutical company in Manchester or
27m3s: South Manchester not really Manchester
27m5s: at all uh in all the edge mfield you
27m8s: know I&amp;#39;m sure you know who is anyway um
27m10s: they have some offices just near
27m11s: Manchester Airport uh near gatley and
27m14s: there was an Armenian uh Cafe that used
27m16s: to go to every day it was fantastic uh
27m20s: lots of Armenian food anyway random so
27m22s: Gregorian welcome welcome welcome
27m24s: welcome so we can see that the default
27m27s: is an in memory SQL Li so let&amp;#39;s go back
27m29s: out there and remove that before I
27m33s: confuse myself with
27m35s: it so now if we say the same thing but
27m38s: in this directory in our project
27m40s: directory cdsn requires DB what do we
27m42s: get we get something similar but not
27m44s: quite the same
27m46s: look a SQL like database but a
27m49s: persistent as Carson says a fire a
27m52s: persistent database in a
27m55s: file so that&amp;#39;s the difference and that&amp;#39;s
27m57s: why and that came that&amp;#39;s come from let&amp;#39;s
28m0s: get rid of that get rid of that get rid
28m1s: of that that&amp;#39;s come
28m3s: from here right we added that okay
28m8s: now if we were to change this back to in
28m11s: memory let&amp;#39;s do that
28m14s: now
28m16s: um uh memory like that let&amp;#39;s see what
28m20s: happens shall we let&amp;#39;s see what happens
28m22s: CDs CDs
28m24s: watch don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going to happen
28m26s: let&amp;#39;s che&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s see
28m29s: great now look connect to DB SQL light
28m33s: memory why is that restarted don&amp;#39;t know
28m36s: connect DQ URL in memory memory right
28m39s: and suddenly we get this in it from we
28m43s: get more lines we get in it from the
28m45s: countries from countries from the books
28m46s: from the and in there as well look DB
28m49s: data sap com sap sap common
28m54s: countries okay so now I also the whole
28m59s: model has been deployed so there&amp;#39;s an
29m2s: implicit deployment to an inmemory SQL
29m6s: light database the default so if we run
29m8s: this now refresh not only do we not get
29m12s: an error anymore we also get data
29m13s: because this is just a projection right
29m15s: where is it um ah Services there this
29m20s: banana service with the something entity
29m24s: is basically a
29m25s: projection onto
29m28s: that one okay so we get the same data
29m31s: right books there we get the same data
29m34s: but we don&amp;#39;t get the ID this thing here
29m37s: it says just the title element not
29m41s: anything else okay if again DJ stop
29m45s: digressing but I&amp;#39;m going to do this
29m47s: right I&amp;#39;m going to do this I&amp;#39;m going to
29m48s: say books and then put a let&amp;#39;s get rid
29m51s: of it there right
29m54s: um like that now if I do that and take
29m58s: away the curly brackets title right if I
30m1s: go back here I go back to something we
30m4s: get the idea as well because we&amp;#39;re not
30m5s: sort of constraining the properties in
30m8s: our projection anyway that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s for
30m11s: later on right so uh oh Gregorian you&amp;#39;re
30m15s: welcome you&amp;#39;re welcome you&amp;#39;re welcome so
30m17s: now also also also because we&amp;#39;re in
30m19s: memory and because the model has been
30m22s: built and deployed to the memory every
30m23s: time we restart everything we&amp;#39;ve also
30m26s: got the countries brexit land
30m28s: home of the
30m29s: idiots right so Etc right so but that&amp;#39;s
30m34s: a bit of a pain in the
30m36s: backside if we have to sort of keep
30m39s: remembering what we&amp;#39;ve got here and
30m41s: switching and modifying stuff here right
30m46s: so you know what I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re
30m48s: even going to get to I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re
30m50s: going to get to the uh building the
30m51s: association but we get to start building
30m54s: the association between books and
30m56s: authors let me change back to Bookshop
30m58s: SQL light and
31m2s: instead there&amp;#39;s another way there&amp;#39;s a
31m4s: better
31m5s: way this is a great
31m10s: opportunity for us to think about
31m12s: another amazing
31m14s: feature of the cap node.js runtime and
31m19s: that let me save that again so it&amp;#39;s
31m21s: going to
31m22s: restart okay and we&amp;#39;re back to square
31m24s: one as it were if I refresh that you
31m26s: don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t need to refresh it
31m28s: same issue so going back to Kiara&amp;#39;s
31m30s: answer I&amp;#39;m going to do that CDs
31m35s: deploy so now we&amp;#39;ve deployed and of
31m38s: course by default it&amp;#39;s going to read the
31m41s: the N from here right so it&amp;#39;s deployed
31m44s: to the right place so now if we say uh
31m47s: SQL light Bookshop SQL light if we see
31m51s: tables we now also should there we go
31m54s: banana something select start from oops
31m58s: banana uncore
32m1s: something there it
32m4s: is
32m7s: right good morning nites and welcome
32m10s: welcome welcome welcome so let&amp;#39;s get out
32m12s: of that now the what I&amp;#39;m thinking of oh
32m16s: it&amp;#39;s there what I&amp;#39;m thinking
32m18s: of
32m19s: in cap
32m23s: is configuration profiles so put in the
32m27s: chat if you&amp;#39;ve
32m29s: used configuration profiles
32m33s: before
32m35s: right put in the chat if you are curious
32m39s: about them they&amp;#39;re super powerful and
32m42s: also super easy you might have used you
32m44s: might have
32m46s: seen an invocation of the cap server CDs
32m50s: serve D- production okay in fact let&amp;#39;s
32m54s: do that now doesn&amp;#39;t matter if uh it goes
32m56s: wrong because it it will go wrong I&amp;#39;ll
32m58s: tell you why in a minute CDs um watch or
33m1s: serve doesn&amp;#39;t really matter CU we do
33m3s: serve anyway D-
33m5s: production let me put that there because
33m7s: we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot of stuff right
33m10s: in fact let me just clear that first of
33m12s: all there
33m15s: bang why is it gone bang
33m18s: because the production mode as it were
33m23s: also means that the cap server will
33m27s: depend upon will
33m30s: require all sorts of production level
33m34s: services and configuration
33m38s: including some non mock Security Service
33m43s: mechanisms right excess security so
33m46s: while we can&amp;#39;t use-- production--
33m48s: production by the way CDs Pro uh CDs
33m50s: watch--
33m53s: production is just syntactic sugar
33m56s: shorthand syntactic sugar Shand for--
33m59s: profile production same thing right same
34m2s: thing bang okay
34m5s: however we can use the power of these
34m9s: profiles to Define look at that there
34m11s: we&amp;#39;re going to do exactly that sort of
34m13s: thing to
34m15s: Define in fact let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s put
34m19s: that across here let&amp;#39;s open up a new tab
34m22s: so we can sort of see it with our own
34m24s: eyes and how we
34m26s: copy oh so Nesh says great question Nesh
34m30s: how can we use the Hannah database for
34m32s: local HTTP file testing now I&amp;#39;m not sure
34m36s: what you mean specifically with local
34m39s: HTTP file testing what I&amp;#39;m going to
34m41s: interpret that question as is how can we
34m43s: still run cap server locally and also
34m46s: make Local Host HTTP requests which I
34m51s: think you might be referring
34m52s: to but have the data in hand a file and
34m55s: this is hybrid mode and in fact hybrid
34m58s: mode I&amp;#39;ll tell you two things about
35m0s: hybrid mode you can look it up so the
35m1s: keyword is
35m3s: hybrid hybrid is basically a
35m6s: configuration a CDS EnV configuration
35m11s: set that combines running a cap server
35m14s: locally but binding that cap server with
35m17s: remote Services now if you have a look
35m23s: at in fact I&amp;#39;m going to ask a AJ or
35m26s: Kevin are you still there AJ or Kevin
35m28s: put in the chat for me the URL to
35m32s: our uh cap Hannah code Jam in fact I can
35m37s: find it here uh cap Hannah there we go
35m40s: it&amp;#39;s there right in this code Jam it&amp;#39;s
35m44s: an amazing code Jam where are we well
35m45s: there we go in there you will find an
35m50s: example of exactly what you want to do
35m54s: if I understand your question correctly
35m56s: okay so it&amp;#39;s hybrid mode and hybrid mode
35m58s: when you set this up with some
36m1s: cap um magic with the CDs
36m4s: command all of a sudden you have a piece
36m6s: of configuration that you refer to Via a
36m10s: special profile name called hybrid so
36m12s: we&amp;#39;re dealing with profiles there as
36m13s: well profile hybrid right thank you
36m16s: Kevin thank you Kevin sorry I was a bit
36m18s: too a bit too fast there I didn&amp;#39;t give
36m19s: you a chance there you go excellent Good
36m22s: Work Kevin um now so what we&amp;#39;ll do is
36m26s: let&amp;#39;s get rid of
36m28s: that and let&amp;#39;s go into service package
36m32s: and do exactly this so first of all what
36m34s: I&amp;#39;m going to do is I&amp;#39;m going to put
36m35s: everything on the same line
36m38s: here so we can repeat it so let&amp;#39;s say
36m41s: we&amp;#39;ve got a file based like this one
36m44s: here let&amp;#39;s just um let&amp;#39;s add that on a
36m47s: separate line uh there and then put
36m52s: every put that whole thing
36m55s: in uh like that if I say for example I
37m0s: don&amp;#39;t know let&amp;#39;s call this profile
37m3s: prepr in the old days of R three we used
37m7s: to call our sort of you know the systems
37m8s: after development and testing preprod in
37m12s: fact let&amp;#39;s call it testing testing right
37m15s: so now let me just format that as well
37m17s: because then it&amp;#39;s a bit nicer to see
37m21s: right in fact no let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s have that
37m23s: there like that uh there okay uh uh
37m29s: there so
37m31s: now we&amp;#39;ve got
37m35s: our explicit configuration that says use
37m38s: equl light but use a file inside a
37m42s: profile called
37m43s: testing in fact let&amp;#39;s stop here let&amp;#39;s
37m46s: save
37m47s: that and ask ourselves what do you think
37m50s: is going to happen now put in the chat
37m52s: what you think is going to
37m54s: happen I think I think yeah I&amp;#39;m feeling
37m57s: okay nobody said DJ you idiot we want to
38m0s: do associations between books and
38m1s: authors right now so I&amp;#39;m going to carry
38m3s: on in this trajectory because it&amp;#39;s super
38m6s: super
38m7s: interesting to learn about the basics of
38m11s: the power of configuration profiles not
38m14s: only because you can use them yourself
38m15s: but when you come across them when I
38m17s: first started reading this sort of thing
38m19s: it just looks weird with a value of a of
38m22s: a property the key the key of a property
38m25s: in square brackets like what is all that
38m26s: about but it&amp;#39;s just text right and and
38m29s: cap node.js uses that to give us this
38m33s: amazing
38m34s: facility so I&amp;#39;m take a drink of water
38m37s: and somebody put in the chat what you
38m38s: think is going to happen are we going to
38m40s: have an
38m42s: inmemory or are we going to have a
38m44s: Bookshop sequel light or are we going to
38m45s: have an error what&amp;#39;s going to happen
38m47s: when I say CDs
38m53s: watch and while we&amp;#39;re waiting let&amp;#39;s just
38m55s: have a stare at this as well so we can
38m57s: see here we&amp;#39;ve got DB is now not just
39m0s: kqal like blah blah blah but it&amp;#39;s also
39m3s: it&amp;#39;s
39m4s: multiple multiple versions of the same
39m7s: configuration just divided up by what
39m11s: will become these configuration profiles
39m13s: well nobody&amp;#39;s put anything in the chat
39m15s: yet I don&amp;#39;t want to bore you to death so
39m17s: let&amp;#39;s just run it in fact let me just
39m19s: move that up a bit move that up a bit
39m21s: there move that up a bit there give
39m23s: people a chance to say something in the
39m24s: chat come on yes no come on I&amp;#39;m going
39m26s: say something in the chat please let me
39m29s: know what you think is going to
39m32s: happen I&amp;#39;ll give you I&amp;#39;ll give you a
39m34s: clue actually give you a
39m38s: clue oh in fact there&amp;#39;s the clue if the
39m41s: profile is not set to
39m43s: production the development profile is
39m46s: automatically
39m47s: enabled so there&amp;#39;s some defaulting of
39m50s: stuff going on there there&amp;#39;s a bit of a
39m52s: clue CDs watch let&amp;#39;s run
39m56s: it
40m2s: it completely
40m4s: ignores this configuration because this
40m7s: configuration belongs to and only to the
40m11s: now newly defined testing configuration
40m15s: profile Carson says in memory without--
40m17s: profile testing exactly so maybe sorry I
40m20s: apologize maybe the delay between me
40m22s: saying something and it coming out on
40m23s: the
40m24s: YouTubes uh is more than 20 seconds so I
40m26s: apologize caraston has it spot on in
40m30s: memory look in
40m33s: memory so let&amp;#39;s take caston&amp;#39;s suggestion
40m37s: and
40m39s: um uh let&amp;#39;s just do that yes sish
40m42s: without profile it runs in memory so
40m43s: let&amp;#39;s just do that there what&amp;#39;s going on
40m46s: uh what&amp;#39;s going on with my keyboard
40m47s: there we go CDs watch CDs watch-
40m51s: profile well in fact um let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s put
40m55s: something rubbish let&amp;#39;s use a profile
40m58s: called rubbish that doesn&amp;#39;t exist I i&amp;#39;
40m59s: be curious to see what goes on here
41m1s: rubbish it doesn&amp;#39;t find that profile so
41m4s: it does the the default that it finds
41m7s: now if we say here
41m11s: testing it goes to the SQL light based
41m16s: configuration
41m17s: profile now let&amp;#39;s be more explicit then
41m20s: and say here
41m23s: um uh development cuz that&amp;#39;s the default
41m27s: okay the default is development and
41m28s: we&amp;#39;ll have here URL um
41m34s: memory caraston now an error without
41m36s: deployment um well that&amp;#39;s interesting
41m38s: yes I thought I&amp;#39;d have an error as well
41m40s: I&amp;#39;ll look I&amp;#39;ll ask oh I forgot the
41m41s: comment there I&amp;#39;ll ask I&amp;#39;m going to ask
41m43s: internally I&amp;#39;ve made a mental note to
41m44s: ask internally why when we did rubbish
41m47s: it said there&amp;#39;s no profile called
41m48s: rubbish there&amp;#39;s probably a good reason
41m49s: for it that my brain is too small to
41m51s: understand but there we go so now I&amp;#39;ve
41m53s: saved
41m54s: that we&amp;#39;re still running with profile
41m57s: testing so let me get rid of the profile
41m59s: again it&amp;#39;s still going to do the the inm
42m1s: the in memory one but that&amp;#39;s because
42m3s: it&amp;#39;s by default it&amp;#39;s either the implicit
42m6s: or the one that&amp;#39;s development so there
42m7s: we go so that there um let&amp;#39;s just do
42m11s: that and see dash dash profile
42m14s: development same thing or no data same
42m17s: thing okay so this is a really good way
42m19s: and we&amp;#39;ll keep this now this is a really
42m21s: good way of being able to switch between
42m23s: the uh the SQL light file and the SQL in
42m27s: memory okay does that make
42m29s: sense right I think we I think we might
42m32s: have chance to very briefly because I
42m35s: described it in the blog post to very
42m37s: briefly get the iso data and then right
42m39s: at the very end I think we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll
42m41s: start to do an association how about
42m44s: that okay so if we have a look at uh ISO
42m49s: data for no qat let&amp;#39;s go to my block
42m52s: post there&amp;#39;s a link there ISO content
42m54s: for common
42m55s: types um here we go welcome to where is
42m59s: it where is it where is it here we go
43m0s: package CDs common content I don&amp;#39;t know
43m2s: why it doesn&amp;#39;t come up why is
43m4s: that why does not not come
43m7s: up what is wrong with the content there
43m10s: being served that happened a minute ago
43m12s: there should be text there okay anyway
43m14s: anyway all we need to do all we need to
43m17s: do
43m19s: is add that package right so let&amp;#39;s do
43m24s: that so let&amp;#39;s go to let&amp;#39;s walk Watch
43m27s: What Happens inside
43m30s: of packages. Json in fact shall we clean
43m33s: this up first shall we yes let&amp;#39;s clean
43m35s: this up first let&amp;#39;s clean it up so let&amp;#39;s
43m37s: get rid
43m39s: of the banana service and also get let&amp;#39;s
43m42s: get rid of this stuff as well the DB
43m44s: data right this this is the the the the
43m47s: two rubbish um records that I created
43m50s: before let&amp;#39;s get rid of the whole thing
43m51s: with nothing in authors nothing in books
43m53s: we got those two rubbish records there
43m54s: nothing in there so let&amp;#39;s get rid of
43m55s: that whole directory delete permanently
43m58s: bit of a clean up there so all we&amp;#39;ve now
44m0s: got is booksh of authors the two authors
44m2s: and the books okay and we&amp;#39;ve got in our
44m4s: services we&amp;#39;ve got the CID and Country
44m7s: there we go so let&amp;#39;s save that and CDs
44m10s: watch and run it with development right
44m12s: in development mode by sort of
44m14s: default okay now we can also now say npm
44m19s: ad and AD is just a synonym for install
44m22s: but add semantically for me sounds a bit
44m25s: better sap CDs
44m27s: content now if we have a look inside
44m30s: node modules it should end up inside of
44m33s: here right so let&amp;#39;s do
44m40s: that 21 package looking for funding I
44m44s: always confused added one package and
44m46s: I&amp;#39;m not sure that that updates correctly
44m48s: because if we look in node modules at
44m51s: sap we can now see CDs common content in
44m55s: fact um let&amp;#39;s just go here because I I
44m58s: like this much better if we go to cap
45m2s: B2B there we go and then have a look at
45m5s: that now inside of the node modules
45m8s: where is it there we&amp;#39;ve got sap CDs
45m10s: common content we&amp;#39;ve
45m13s: got some stuff and this look at all that
45m16s: all those CSV files look at all those
45m19s: CSV files okay so we got all those
45m21s: C now all we have to do
45m25s: now
45m27s: is add this using directive into our CDs
45m31s: into our model
45m33s: definition so let&amp;#39;s do that
45m35s: now uh let&amp;#39;s go to here and open paste
45m41s: close and let&amp;#39;s CDs watch okay check
45m45s: this out that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve got so far
45m47s: Bookshop books and Bookshop authors
45m48s: let&amp;#39;s go to the Local Host there uh
45m52s: Local Host there
45m54s: 404 nothing in oh oh yeah the three
45m57s: three items in books let me put my face
45m58s: at the bottom three items in books
46m0s: authors two authors country code let&amp;#39;s
46m2s: let&amp;#39;s leave that null for now um and
46m5s: nothing in countries right now let&amp;#39;s
46m7s: save this and let&amp;#39;s also see what
46m10s: happens when we save it and of course
46m12s: we&amp;#39;re running CS watch so we should
46m13s: restart let&amp;#39;s
46m17s: see bang amazing what is going on here
46m22s: look at that what we get some more stuff
46m25s: loaded so the model is now loaded not
46m27s: just from Services CDs and also of
46m29s: course sap CDs common which is from this
46m32s: thing here but also from node modules at
46m35s: sep CDs common context look there it
46m39s: is
46m41s: now books same authors same but now
46m48s: drumroll we&amp;#39;ve got ISO
46m51s: data now it&amp;#39;s as simple as that how does
46m55s: that work why does that that work that&amp;#39;s
46m58s: what the blog post explains and that&amp;#39;s
47m0s: why it I seem to have taken so long to
47m3s: explain it right it goes into
47m5s: excruciating detail as to what is going
47m8s: on okay and it&amp;#39;s all to do with this
47m12s: magically named index. CDs file
47m17s: in this package we&amp;#39;ve just
47m20s: imported okay so we go down the rabbit
47m22s: hole can everybody tell me what that
47m24s: that uh that curious un curious phrases
47m27s: a reference to what literary work anyway
47m30s: go down a rabbit
47m31s: hole brilliant we 8:46 we&amp;#39;ve got time I
47m35s: think we&amp;#39;ve got time to get to
47m38s: finally finally finally let&amp;#39;s actually
47m40s: let&amp;#39;s get rid of this now let&amp;#39;s just
47m42s: undo that um uh because let&amp;#39;s just you
47m44s: know we don&amp;#39;t really want that anymore
47m46s: and also npm one install scpcs common
47m54s: content okay now
47m58s: uh CDs
48m0s: watch we back to no data okay good now
48m6s: please paste the oh yes okay I will NES
48m8s: please paste the URL in the chat thank
48m10s: you for NES that is brilliant if I
48m13s: forget something any anytime please just
48m16s: let me know
48m18s: brilliant there we go so there&amp;#39;s the URL
48m20s: to the description of what CDs common
48m23s: content is how to use it which is really
48m26s: simple and how it works and why it works
48m28s: and why it does what it
48m30s: does and reading through that will
48m33s: also give you a bit of an insight into
48m35s: lots of different bits and pieces of the
48m37s: no. JS cap mechanism it&amp;#39;s wonderful as
48m40s: in the no JS cap mechanism not my blog
48m43s: postable cap is
48m45s: wonderful okay so that&amp;#39;s that that&amp;#39;s
48m48s: that
48m50s: right the last 10 minutes or
48m55s: so what we&amp;#39;ll do is we&amp;#39;ll clean up a
48m59s: little bit more actually we don&amp;#39;t want
49m0s: this country of birth anymore just keep
49m2s: it as simple as possible let&amp;#39;s get rid
49m3s: of that and that and save that so now
49m7s: all we have in our
49m10s: metadata is something super
49m13s: simple up there you can see we&amp;#39;ve got
49m16s: our entity container that contains just
49m18s: two entity sets books and authors and in
49m21s: fact we can also
49m23s: see that the books and authors entity
49m26s: sets are more or less the same they got
49m28s: an ID and a title on here&amp;#39;s an ID and a
49m30s: name but they&amp;#39;re basically a string
49m31s: right exactly that what we&amp;#39;ve got
49m34s: there so how do we go about put in the
49m38s: chat what we need to do to relate books
49m43s: to authors remember when we had just a
49m46s: minute ago we
49m47s: had where was it uh we had this extra
49m51s: field the value for which was null on
49m53s: each of the entities in the entity set
49m56s: when we had that countri in fact let me
49m59s: put that back in again there let&amp;#39;s just
50m1s: run that
50m3s: again the uh author&amp;#39;s entity definition
50m6s: how F country of birth and with type
50m10s: country and country that is defined as
50m13s: an association to sap common countries
50m15s: so when we have when we looked at this
50m18s: not that when we looked at
50m22s: this we had this magically generated for
50m26s: it&amp;#39;s because this definition
50m32s: here is expressed using the association
50m36s: directive or
50m38s: keyword I wonder what the word is
50m41s: keyword I think
50m44s: Association and this creates for us a
50m48s: so-called managed
50m50s: Association
50m52s: okay is Anybody Everybody familiar with
50m54s: manage associations manage
50m59s: associations managed here we go managed
51m2s: to one Association there we go let&amp;#39;s put
51m3s: that in the chat
51m6s: there
51m8s: now now now now get rid of that and get
51m12s: rid of that notice how this is
51m13s: constructed as well somebody put in the
51m17s: chat what this property name consists of
51m22s: what the what is the thing on the left
51m23s: of the underscore and what is the thing
51m25s: on the right of the underscore where
51m26s: does it come
51m27s: from while you&amp;#39;re thinking of that I&amp;#39;m
51m30s: actually going to get rid of
51m32s: it save that again so now all we have is
51m36s: the IDE and name that that that um
51m38s: country of birth underscore code is
51m41s: gone now let&amp;#39;s start to think about what
51m44s: we want to do we want to be able to go
51m47s: from a book to its author and for the
51m50s: sake of argument right now let&amp;#39;s just
51m52s: say each book only has one author so
51m55s: we&amp;#39;re talking specifically about a
51m57s: managed to one Association that&amp;#39;s what
52m0s: that that&amp;#39;s how to sort of think about
52m2s: that how to pronounce it a managed to
52m4s: one Association as as opposed to a too
52m7s: many right we&amp;#39;ll do a too many shortly
52m11s: maybe next time um so all we need to do
52m15s: is to think about saying Well
52m18s: author and remember this is an element
52m22s: in the book&amp;#39;s entity an element name
52m25s: should be lowercase
52m27s: and this is of course singular because
52m28s: it&amp;#39;s a 21 Association so you know not
52m31s: con not necessarily convention but it
52m33s: makes sense to call it lowercase
52m35s: singular author
52m39s: right you know some
52m41s: people I get into this now some people
52m43s: say
52m45s: to call them to author because they
52m49s: know that it&amp;#39;s going to be a navigation
52m51s: property in in the metadata but let&amp;#39;s
52m55s: not even go there right now author
52m58s: associate now this is where if you&amp;#39;re
53m0s: using vs code the amazing extension for
53m4s: cap no J development comes into play so
53m6s: we get this helper here tab Association
53m10s: to and then let&amp;#39;s start toing toping to
53m14s: let&amp;#39;s start typing authors there we go
53m16s: look at that authors tab
53m19s: semicolon okay not saved it yet somebody
53m22s: said Kevin said but what if a book has
53m24s: multiple
53m25s: authors I was hoping somebody would ask
53m28s: that then you
53m30s: need a too many too many a many to many
53m35s: Association now out of the box at the
53m38s: moment cap can do a 2 one Association
53m41s: and a 2 many but if you want a many to
53m44s: many as in a one to one and a one to
53m47s: many but if you want a many to
53m49s: many which is I suppose more realistic
53m52s: in the literary world you know a book
53m56s: might have two authors and an author
53m58s: might have written more than one
54m1s: book then you need a sort of a helper
54m5s: table which is not what we&amp;#39;re going to
54m8s: look at today because that&amp;#39;s too complex
54m10s: in fact there is somewhere somewhere
54m13s: somewhere
54m15s: somewhere we did already on the hands of
54m17s: SCP Dev show didn&amp;#39;t we a whole series on
54m20s: managed associations where I covered
54m23s: this many to many Association where is
54m25s: it can anybody see it manag associations
54m27s: there we go check it out so if you want
54m29s: to dig deeper right in this playlist
54m32s: here of four live
54m35s: streams we cover exactly the answer to
54m37s: Kevin&amp;#39;s question but it&amp;#39;s I would say
54m41s: it&amp;#39;s not appropriate for the Back to
54m43s: Basics because it&amp;#39;s not
54m45s: basic anyway let&amp;#39;s save
54m50s: that and now let&amp;#39;s
54m54s: refresh well all right let&amp;#39;s refresh the
54m56s: auth there should be no change correct
54m59s: there&amp;#39;s no change if we now refresh the
55m1s: books we now see we&amp;#39;ve got another
55m4s: property so we can see this pattern
55m6s: can&amp;#39;t we when we have an association
55m9s: when we have an element that is defined
55m12s: as an
55m14s: association like this a 21 Association
55m17s: managed
55m18s: Association we automatically get at the
55m21s: persistence layer and then that&amp;#39;s of
55m22s: course exposed as a property in the
55m24s: actual API in the in the
55m28s: service in in od data in this case we
55m31s: get this foreign key field thing
55m35s: here so now all we have to do is go to
55m40s: books in fact let&amp;#39;s go go to bring
55m42s: authors in there as well because we&amp;#39;ll
55m44s: need to refer to that won&amp;#39;t we right
55m45s: this authors thing here
55m48s: um let&amp;#39;s copy that let&amp;#39;s go up to here
55m51s: that&amp;#39;s Douglas
55m52s: Adams uh let&amp;#39;s paste that
55m56s: paste that and then let&amp;#39;s go down here
55m58s: again and let&amp;#39;s just say here uh I&amp;#39;ve
56m1s: got Vim mode on so I can where is it I I
56m3s: can do um copy to comma o not change the
56m7s: comma uh yank to comma and I can go up
56m12s: here and then paste that so now we&amp;#39;
56m15s: built this
56m17s: relationship oh here we go um nites says
56m20s: uh in your upcoming sessions can you
56m22s: show an example to consume an external
56m23s: service and merge it with a C Service
56m25s: data
56m26s: yes uh they might be in a while because
56m30s: that&amp;#39;s also something I want to build up
56m33s: to and you know you know me and
56m35s: digressions if you want to jump
56m38s: ahead we also have cap service integ
56m44s: service in what is wrong with my typing
56m47s: integration there we go we have another
56m51s: code Jam the content of which is also
56m53s: available uh online public openly
56m56s: because of course we are open in the
56m58s: develop Advocates team you can get all
57m0s: the information from there about ex
57m2s: doing exactly what you just asked for
57m4s: consuming external service and merging
57m6s: it with a cap service data so if you
57m8s: want to codam on that let us know uh
57m11s: Kevin can maybe uh send a link in the
57m13s: chat to Tom&amp;#39;s post about so you want to
57m15s: host a code Jam in our application no in
57m17s: our codejam group to find out how to
57m20s: request a codam anyway and also Stefano
57m23s: says where does that error during type
57m25s: generation come from that&amp;#39;s a good
57m26s: question this thing it come it&amp;#39;s down
57m27s: here sometimes isn&amp;#39;t it I don&amp;#39;t know I
57m29s: don&amp;#39;t really use vs code normally I only
57m32s: use vs code for the live stream um and I
57m34s: never see that normally so I think it&amp;#39;s
57m37s: to do with the uh the CDs extension for
57m41s: vs code but I&amp;#39;ve already got another
57m44s: thing I want to ask the folks about
57m46s: internally so I&amp;#39;ll also ask them about
57m48s: that okay so thank you for asking that
57m50s: Stan know good eagle eyes there so now
57m52s: we&amp;#39;ve got this new author uncore
57m57s: so I&amp;#39;ve added that there but of course I
57m58s: also need to add that as
58m1s: the CSV header
58m4s: field right if I said for if I made a
58m7s: mistake and got rid of it I save that
58m9s: what&amp;#39;s going to happen we&amp;#39;re going to
58m10s: get an error again because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s
58m11s: actually looking at the CSV header field
58m14s: and trying to insert this third value
58m16s: this third value according to the
58m17s: headers here third column into a
58m19s: property in at the ddl the pist layer
58m23s: called author unscribe doesn&amp;#39;t exist ID
58m26s: ID save that should restart redeploy
58m30s: we&amp;#39;re in memory we&amp;#39;re good how yes it
58m33s: how to host how to host codejam perfect
58m35s: thank you
58m35s: Kevin so now if I refresh that we get
58m39s: the author uncore ID but the most
58m42s: magical thing and we got two minutes
58m43s: left the most magical thing is that
58m46s: now because of did I not save that I
58m49s: didn&amp;#39;t even make any changes there let&amp;#39;s
58m51s: get rid of that let&amp;#39;s close that yes
58m52s: don&amp;#39;t
58m53s: save because I&amp;#39;ve defined this
58m57s: Association this Association
59m0s: Now sort of comes to the surface in the
59m4s: edmx in the metadata in the O dat
59m6s: service that we&amp;#39;re serving now as where
59m9s: is it where is it where is it a
59m12s: navigation
59m13s: property authors there look there
59m16s: there&amp;#39;s our entity type
59m18s: books there navigation property name
59m21s: equals author so now you all know you
59m24s: all know what I&amp;#39;m going to do now
59m25s: Bookshop
59m26s: look let&amp;#39;s look at the
59m28s: books expand equals author so finally
59m32s: with such a simple single expression a
59m36s: managed 21
59m37s: Association we can jump from books to
59m41s: their authors and of course everything
59m42s: else work if we could just say you know
59m44s: um filter what anyway I&amp;#39;m not going to
59m47s: get into that right
59m49s: now so there we go we finally started on
59m52s: our
59m52s: journey to relate books and all authors
59m56s: it&amp;#39;s still now I will say one
60m0s: thing to keep things simple and to sort
60m2s: of emphasize things we&amp;#39;re still Del
60m4s: we&amp;#39;ve still got everything defined our
60m6s: entities we we normally think about the
60m8s: persistence layer defined
60m11s: inside the service definition so it&amp;#39;s
60m14s: quite hard it&amp;#39;s possible but it&amp;#39;s quite
60m16s: hard to refer to those entities in other
60m19s: services especially if they&amp;#39;re in other
60m20s: files and you sort of it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s
60m23s: like tying your shoelaces wronger than
60m25s: tripping up
60m26s: right so next time as well we&amp;#39;ll start
60m29s: to clean this up and sort of separate
60m31s: out the persistence layer stuff the
60m36s: entities and the relationships from the
60m38s: service layer stuff and we&amp;#39;ll put them
60m40s: in the separate DB and serve directors
60m42s: and will&amp;#39;ll feel a lot better for that&amp;#39;s
60m43s: like having a having a shower or tying
60m44s: your shoelaces
60m46s: properly okay that&amp;#39;s the end of the
60m48s: episode I&amp;#39;ve finished actually on time
