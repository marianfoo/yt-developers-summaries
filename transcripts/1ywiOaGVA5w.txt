3m22s: excuse me Q mro oh still got a cough and
3m25s: I&amp;#39;ve just
3m26s: realized I&amp;#39;m not taken my jump off yet

3m31s: basically welcome and thanks for joining
3m33s: good morning to Tom to fol Aloha to you
3m37s: uh FKA and to Nico I do like that music
3m40s: as well um this is if you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re
3m43s: not sure what we&amp;#39;re talking about music-
3m45s: wise Kara good morning to breia to you
3m48s: in breia excellent um yeah we&amp;#39;re talking
3m50s: about uh really nice um countdown little
3m55s: video um let us know what you think in
3m57s: the chat good morning morning to you
3m59s: akib uh good morning AP in dorf um yeah
4m4s: let us know what you think about this
4m6s: little bit of a
4m7s: countdown style thing uh lovingly and uh
4m13s: in in great detail put together by our
4m16s: one and only friend
4m18s: Nico uh so let us know what you think
4m21s: because I think it&amp;#39;s fair to say that
4m23s: you know it&amp;#39;s not that straightforward
4m26s: if we want to keep it up to date with
4m27s: you know a new featured piece of
4m30s: documentation the latest upcoming sap
4m32s: developer news and everything then of
4m34s: course you know we got to keep it up to
4m36s: date so let us know in the chat right
4m41s: now um what you think and whether we
4m43s: should continue with it because if you
4m46s: like it then we can and will continue
4m49s: with it if it&amp;#39;s you know not that
4m51s: interesting then you know we&amp;#39;ll knock it
4m53s: on the head because it&amp;#39;s quite a lot of
4m54s: work anyway good morning kic uh why was
4m57s: the npm package for cap named as sacds
5m0s: and sacs DK cic I love it straight in
5m3s: there with a question directly uh why
5m6s: was the mpm package named um for cap oh
5m10s: I see um for cap as in you know
5m12s: obviously you capitalizing cap because
5m14s: it&amp;#39;s an acronym but are you thinking it
5m17s: might be otherwise SCP cap that&amp;#39;s a
5m20s: really good question I mean I think the
5m24s: the heart of cap is CDS um and it&amp;#39;s
5m27s: really all about CDs and all Al you know
5m30s: what thinking about it it&amp;#39;s such a great
5m32s: question thank you for um you know
5m34s: saying it out loud what probably all of
5m36s: us were thinking internally without even
5m39s: realizing now sap is quite keen on using
5m42s: proper names for products and everything
5m45s: and I think it&amp;#39;s still fair to say that
5m47s: cap is still a little bit rebellious
5m49s: it&amp;#39;s still a bit little bit sort of
5m50s: illegal to say the word cap because
5m53s: officially you know we should say sap
5m55s: Cloud application programming model but
5m57s: of course that&amp;#39;s such a complete
5m59s: mouthful and impossible to say you know
6m1s: more than once without stumbling over
6m3s: your tongue that we all say cap but cap
6m7s: I think uh well not I think I know
6m11s: wasn&amp;#39;t and maybe still isn&amp;#39;t an official
6m14s: name from a branding perspective so
6m17s: maybe that&amp;#39;s why they chose CDs I don&amp;#39;t
6m19s: know I don&amp;#39;t know that that would be my
6m20s: guess but it&amp;#39;s a great question a great
6m22s: question to start off with um and would
6m24s: it have been oh oh uh oh yes so I just
6m28s: saw the second sentence that you said
6m29s: would it have been easier if they named
6m30s: it sa cap um it creates a lot of
6m33s: confusion for newes that&amp;#39;s interesting
6m35s: I&amp;#39;ll feed that back I don&amp;#39;t think
6m37s: they&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;ll change it now but um I
6m40s: you know I think I think um that&amp;#39;s
6m42s: that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s a great question chakia
6m46s: good morning uh the travel was okay well
6m48s: actually it was the whole code the whole
6m50s: codm experience I&amp;#39;ve just been U just

7m5s: door too from leaving the hotel in
7m7s: Warsaw yesterday morning to getting back

8m37s: having my first coffee um I&amp;#39;m going to
8m40s: be leaving this Marina I&amp;#39;m in a Marina
8m41s: at the moment I stayed over in the
8m42s: marina over winter yeah I need coffee
8m44s: have I need coffee and I&amp;#39;m planning my
8m46s: next route and I thought I should just
8m49s: leave this up here I&amp;#39;m going to go to uh
8m51s: salt house dot in Liverpool just give a
8m53s: zoom out just to show you where I am and
8m55s: where this whole thing is as the UK and
8m57s: everything brexit land as it&amp;#39;s now
8m58s: called
8m59s: um and um I&amp;#39;m going to be traveling at
9m2s: the end of this month basically making
9m4s: my way over a couple of weeks to um to
9m6s: Liverpool docks beautiful uh amazing
9m9s: place I&amp;#39;m going to stay there for a bit
9m11s: and I I think it&amp;#39;s just it might be
9m13s: interesting for you to to see you know
9m15s: the way that I plan my route there&amp;#39;s
9m16s: Bridges here and I need to know where
9m18s: the swing bridges are so I have to open
9m20s: them with my key and stop the traffic
9m21s: and everything go through and then you
9m23s: go down here and then here&amp;#39;s a winding
9m25s: hole but basically if I need to turn
9m26s: around and go back the other way you you
9m28s: need to look for a winding hole cuz the
9m29s: canal is quite narrow and the canal the
9m31s: narrow boats are quite long and then
9m33s: down here got some locks there&amp;#39;s a lock
9m35s: now actually the the arrow as it were
9m38s: going that way means that that is going
9m39s: Upstream so you here I&amp;#39;m going to be
9m42s: descending going here going from east to
9m44s: west I&amp;#39;m going to be descending down a
9m46s: level in that lock there there&amp;#39;s
9m48s: princess dock princess dock lock down
9m50s: there so descending down down down into
9m52s: the sort of the Basin so anyway that&amp;#39;s
9m54s: going to be my journey and you can see
9m55s: the route here has got Bridges and
9m58s: aqueducts some winding holes and locks
10m1s: here and bridges more bridges and
10m3s: everything so that&amp;#39;s how I and also what
10m5s: I love is this stuff is still measured
10m7s: in fur Longs which is about roughly 200
10m10s: 200
10m11s: M anyway that&amp;#39;s that did you know did

13m45s: brilliant okay
13m49s: so open Telemetry plugin it doesn&amp;#39;t
13m51s: matter what Telemetry is it&amp;#39;s basically
13m53s: you know extra measurements you know it
13m55s: took this long to do this and it took
13m56s: this long to do this and it took this
13m57s: long to do this and everything and open
13m59s: Telemetry is a
14m0s: thing but the key thing I want to show
14m4s: just very briefly is how Bonkers easy it
14m6s: is to use CD some CDs plugins um you
14m9s: know you can just well let&amp;#39;s do it open
14m11s: to it provides observability features
14m14s: such as tracing and metrics okay so
14m16s: it&amp;#39;ll give you stuff like this you know
14m19s: these these milliseconds and blah blah
14m20s: blah and this is what happened and woo
14m22s: yes and it can send it to uh open
14m24s: Telemetry uh instrumentation sort of uh
14m27s: recipients and everything but just for
14m29s: now cap JS Telemetry uh is the package
14m33s: now if we say this is what where we left
14m35s: off last week uh we have our simple
14m38s: service and all it is is a service with
14m42s: a function defined we played played
14m44s: around with this and we um run it and
14m46s: then we go hello world that&amp;#39;s fine
14m47s: because we&amp;#39;ve got the implementation of
14m49s: the service in our banana. JS it&amp;#39;s not
14m51s: in service. JS so we deliberately want
14m54s: to explicitly say where the
14m55s: implementation is now if we just say NPS
14m58s: M add cap JS now um fulker can you
15m3s: describe maybe or anybody describe what
15m6s: this cap JS prefix is uh why it&amp;#39;s called
15m8s: CAP JS what it&amp;#39;s for and everything in
15m10s: fact in fact in this week&amp;#39;s developer
15m12s: news um Nora talks about best of cap JS
15m19s: uh the website and everything so uh have
15m21s: a look at that so uh it&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s related
15m23s: so Capt tell oh in fact there we go if I
15m25s: run that again if I run CDs watch um
15m28s: there we go let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s start that up
15m30s: logged in with the wrong account excuse
15m31s: a Mah bit of French there on a Friday
15m33s: morning from Nico excellent uh so they
15m36s: go I&amp;#39;m running running running running
15m38s: running running running making these
15m39s: requests okay so we get the basic uh
15m41s: logging output if we add mpm add cap JS
15m47s: Telemetry let&amp;#39;s just add that see what
15m50s: see what&amp;#39;s going to happen uh so f is
15m52s: saying cap JS double equals nicely done
15m55s: there Falcon nicely done there is the
15m57s: JavaScript Edition
15m59s: of cap exactly and it&amp;#39;s a sort of the
16m4s: the community and sap sort of combined
16m7s: sort of space and name space for mpm
16m9s: packages so you know folks can
16m10s: contribute in fact while we&amp;#39;re waiting
16m12s: for this oh it&amp;#39;s installed um while
16m13s: we&amp;#39;re waiting for this to install it&amp;#39;s
16m14s: installed already best of cap
16m17s: JS best of cap JS look at that that&amp;#39;s in
16m20s: the news as well so I&amp;#39;ll just paste that
16m22s: anyway there we
16m24s: go uh there we go hot packages all these
16m27s: different packages cap and ui5 and we&amp;#39;ve
16m30s: ALS you&amp;#39;ll also have things from um caps
16m34s: uh so have a look at that as well it&amp;#39;s
16m36s: amazing caps notifications CDs plugin
16m38s: there&amp;#39;s another plugin so we&amp;#39;ve just
16m40s: installed this plugin now if I run CDs
16m43s: watch watch
16m44s: happens I&amp;#39;m just going to run that let
16m46s: that start
16m49s: up and then hit refresh here again and
16m52s: there we go we get to L look I mean
16m56s: could that be any easier anyway that&amp;#39;s
16m59s: that so let&amp;#39;s remove it again because we
17m1s: don&amp;#39;t want to confuse ourselves uh mpm
17m3s: remove uh fine that was just a little
17m5s: bit of a digression and it&amp;#39;s you know
17m7s: it&amp;#39;s already 8:15 DJ what are you
17m9s: doing okay
17m12s: now what I want to talk to you about
17m14s: today or talk with you because I want
17m16s: your opinion we have super fantastic
17m18s: people all in the chat here so let me
17m20s: know what you think let me know if I&amp;#39;m
17m22s: doing things wrong let me know if you
17m23s: want to have a play around with
17m24s: something slightly differently but
17m25s: generally the direction I want to take
17m27s: us in today
17m29s: is to start by building the
17m34s: simplest cap
17m36s: service not a service that is like a
17m39s: little hello world with a with a with a
17m40s: no data function
17m43s: input but a service with one or two
17m47s: entities okay we&amp;#39;re going to start
17m49s: defining as simple as possible okay
17m51s: remember in a previous episode we looked
17m53s: at the DB serve and apple I should I say
17m56s: all the way around the DB the serve and
17m58s: the Apple app uh
18m0s: directory uh where we have the DB
18m3s: directory for you know
18m5s: traditionally um the the entity
18m8s: definitions the definitions which are
18m10s: closest to the persistence layer so this
18m12s: is where you will Define our entities in
18m14s: the serve directory you might have CDs
18m16s: definitions to Define services and the
18m17s: app directory is where you put your
18m18s: front ends and stuff let leave that for
18m20s: now however you don&amp;#39;t have to do that
18m23s: and as we saw in fact we blasted away
18m25s: there are no app DB or serve directories
18m28s: here all we&amp;#39;ve got is this Services CDs
18m30s: which is this thing
18m33s: here and we&amp;#39;ve got our banana JS um
18m37s: implementation so actually let&amp;#39;s
18m42s: remove banana JS so we&amp;#39;ve only got
18m45s: services. CDs of course now when I when
18m47s: I run that nothing happens run that CDs
18m49s: watch when I run that uh we should have
18m52s: oh yeah okay we even get an error here
18m54s: look at that oops ports that didn&amp;#39;t that
18m56s: we even get error here amazing
18m59s: error on serice start fail loading
19m0s: service implementation from banana. JS
19m2s: that&amp;#39;s because we&amp;#39;ve still got that up
19m3s: here so let&amp;#39;s uh delete
19m7s: that save that and now it&amp;#39;s fine because
19m12s: basically we&amp;#39;re explicitly we were
19m14s: explicitly telling the cap server go and
19m17s: load this file because that&amp;#39;s where the
19m19s: implementation is okay so we went and
19m22s: tried to load the file and it couldn&amp;#39;t
19m24s: find the file so it gave us an error now
19m27s: we&amp;#39;re not EXP basically telling it where
19m29s: the implementation is so it will assume
19m32s: if it exists that the implementation for
19m34s: this this particular service so the
19m36s: service definition brackets s in this
19m39s: file is in a file called services. JS as
19m42s: we found out from last time
19m44s: right um and but so it doesn&amp;#39;t try to
19m47s: look you know if it because it&amp;#39;s
19m50s: implicit it&amp;#39;s not going to give us an
19m52s: error if services. JS doesn&amp;#39;t exist
19m55s: however it will give us an error if we
19m57s: try and run this now because it will say
19m59s: service say has no handle okay right
20m2s: okay so far so good so uh rashar says
20m5s: cap JS is starting point for
20m7s: CDs
20m9s: um I&amp;#39;m not sure what you mean there uh
20m13s: CJs basically that actual you know those
20m15s: six characters cap DJs is the names
20m18s: space prefix for npm packages for the
20m21s: node.js
20m22s: uh cap uh for all sorts of packages so
20m27s: don&amp;#39;t wor in the house well welcome to
20m28s: John I was chatting to John last night
20m30s: bar go great to see the latest update to
20m31s: Cap all is receiving from the community
20m33s: exactly so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a really nice
20m35s: way of thinking about what cap J about
20m37s: as well which is allowing the community
20m39s: allowing you know it&amp;#39;s a facility for
20m41s: the community to contribute as well and
20m42s: stand shoulder-to-shoulder with you know
20m45s: every Everybody cap team so Javier says
20m47s: question are those cap jsnp modules
20m48s: following any security policy to make
20m49s: them available to use at Enterprise
20m51s: level uh if so where can we find the
20m53s: documentation of the security policies
20m54s: and or check that those mpm modules
20m56s: should pass
20m59s: um I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s any
21m2s: explicit security policies what security
21m5s: policies were you thinking of in
21m7s: particular and how might that differ
21m9s: from anything else open source that you
21m11s: might use in the Enterprise let me
21m13s: know um so uh or are you talking about
21m18s: um what fuler is answering here uh it
21m21s: Maps authorization from the uh sort of
21m24s: external ID entra entra to the uh like
21m27s: as your active to the cap authorization
21m29s: artifacts are you are you talking more
21m32s: about how external security and role
21m35s: based authentication maps onto
21m37s: Enterprises or are you talking more
21m39s: generally about you know how secure are
21m41s: these modules to use in the Enterprise
21m43s: let us know great questions great
21m46s: questions okay so while we think about
21m50s: that let&amp;#39;s think about building
21m56s: ourselves of simple service okay and I
22m0s: think by stumbling through building a
22m2s: simple service hopefully we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll
22m5s: learn things we&amp;#39;ll find out things
22m6s: ourselves so why don&amp;#39;t we why don&amp;#39;t we
22m8s: start
22m10s: out s by just
22m14s: defining okay defining the simplest
22m17s: service that could possibly work okay so
22m18s: why don&amp;#39;t we say service um Bookshop
22m22s: because you know
22m23s: Bookshop is this you know is is
22m26s: basically uh you know a really simple
22m29s: way you know we have bookshops and I&amp;#39;m
22m31s: not going to try and sort of excuse
22m33s: using Bookshop you know the the the the
22m36s: previous sort of default go-to was sight
22m39s: wasn&amp;#39;t it any anybody um anybody around
22m41s: here in terms of uh you know what it was
22m44s: such a long journey yesterday my and I
22m45s: can I can feel my brain not working
22m47s: properly or working even less properly
22m49s: than normal so I apologies I&amp;#39;m a bit
22m52s: tired actually from the journey ofday so
22m54s: jaier saying I mean checks for
22m55s: vulnerabilities auditing the code well
22m57s: it&amp;#39;s open
22m59s: so that&amp;#39;s exactly the same we&amp;#39;re in the
23m1s: same game we&amp;#39;re in the in the same
23m3s: ballpark as any open source module that
23m5s: you may want to
23m8s: use for example Express Express is an
23m11s: open source module you know that&amp;#39;s
23m14s: actually used part and parcel of cap and
23m18s: anyway yeah that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a great
23m19s: question I I&amp;#39;m not aware that there&amp;#39;s
23m22s: anything extra above and beyond what
23m25s: happens normally in open source and
23m27s: using open source in the Enterprise what
23m30s: happens there great question though
23m32s: anybody got any thoughts on that put it
23m33s: in the chat so we&amp;#39;ve got a service
23m37s: Bookshop and it&amp;#39;s running look loaded
23m40s: model from one file so if we go back
23m43s: here and press refresh we have the you
23m47s: know and we know what this is all about
23m48s: now we got OD V Bookshop we know why the
23m51s: OD V4 preix exists Bookshop is the name
23m55s: from there and then we can look at the
23m56s: metadata which is pretty pretty much
23m58s: empty okay this is an old latest
23m59s: service s flight Phil says SF flight
24m2s: reminds me of Ides International is it
24m5s: International International
24m7s: demonstration and education
24m9s: system yeah wow Happy Days Ides we used
24m13s: to you know it&amp;#39;s like getting an a CD
24m15s: with an idz install was like Goldust
24m17s: wasn&amp;#39;t it you know oh yeah got some got
24m18s: an sap system with some actual data in
24m20s: it amazing um it was called iders I
24m23s: think yes um so sight was basically a
24m26s: you know a set of tables about flights
24m30s: and Airlines and trips and whatever
24m32s: interestingly enough enough there is a
24m36s: um a modern day trip pin there we go o
24m40s: data service um curated by Oasis at
24m44s: services. oa.org there is a trip pin pin
24m48s: service OD data um where is it trip yeah
24m51s: we go sample o data service and that is
24m54s: also about um public transportation and
24m58s: flights and airport locations and
24m59s: everything which you know that&amp;#39;s quite
25m1s: interesting that it&amp;#39;s the same sort of
25m2s: thing again it&amp;#39;s easy for the brain to
25m3s: think about anyway let me just share
25m5s: that with you it&amp;#39;s quite good that&amp;#39;s
25m6s: this is actually quite a good and
25m9s: well-rounded sample OD data V4 um uh
25m13s: service let me share that in the chat as
25m15s: well shows your age fill yes well I mean
25m18s: you know you and me both mate you and me
25m20s: both all PES get rid of that as well
25m22s: there we go okay
25m25s: so now
25m28s: what is a service without entities so
25m31s: let&amp;#39;s start
25m33s: defining an entity simplest thing that
25m35s: could possibly work now I&amp;#39;m sure many of
25m39s: you have seen sample applications from
25m43s: cap where the entities is defined in
25m45s: separate files in separate directories
25m46s: like I&amp;#39;ve talked about with DB Ser an
25m48s: app
25m50s: but
25m52s: um oh here we go what&amp;#39;s this Stefan good
25m54s: morning Stan late comment not late
25m56s: comment comments comment whenever ever
25m58s: whatever late comment regarding the
26m0s: question why the runtime and design time
26m1s: Tools in cap as called CDs I think it&amp;#39;s
26m3s: to align itself with the abap CDs World
26m5s: expressing intent to be for the same
26m7s: purpose that&amp;#39;s a great comment it&amp;#39;s a
26m9s: great observation I&amp;#39;m sure that there&amp;#39;s
26m11s: some uh some logic and Truth in that as
26m13s: well Stan yeah I think that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s
26m16s: good because CDs is the thing that binds
26m18s: it right CDs is a thing that binds this
26m21s: sort of you know in my T my words you
26m23s: know lowercase the golden path of
26m26s: development keeping the core clean and
26m28s: develop your own stuff if you got an
26m30s: abap hat on then it&amp;#39;s WAP and if you got
26m32s: a non-ab hat on then it&amp;#39;s cap but
26m34s: basically you&amp;#39;re writing the same
26m37s: philosophically you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re thinking
26m38s: at the same level in declarative terms
26m41s: in entities and relationships and
26m43s: services and annotations and so on so DJ
26m48s: stop talking start doing now what we&amp;#39;re
26m51s: going to
26m51s: do is Define something so entity
26m56s: books okay okay let&amp;#39;s save that but we
26m59s: also get here an error saying mismatched
27m2s: expecting something you you need to give
27m4s: us something entity books there we go
27m6s: but we still need something as well we
27m7s: need to give us something mismatch
27m8s: expecting something like that so entity
27m10s: books there there look at that that is
27m13s: that the simplest thing that could
27m14s: possibly work well again the amazing
27m17s: thing is that there is there&amp;#39;s so much
27m21s: help for us in this tight design time
27m25s: cycle that look at these beautiful
27m27s: things now some people look at these and
27m29s: say oh my God it&amp;#39;s all disastrous and oh
27m31s: there&amp;#39;s so many errors in cap and
27m32s: everything no no no cap is helping us to
27m37s: do the right thing and telling us stuff
27m39s: look at that so what is it saying here
27m41s: right at the bottom error Services
27m43s: expecting entity to have at least one
27m46s: element which is neither virtual nor
27m47s: calculated I mean it&amp;#39;s saying for
27m49s: goodness sake just what&amp;#39;s the point of
27m51s: having an entity if it&amp;#39;s got no elements
27m53s: in it right which is fine so let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s
27m57s: give it want so I&amp;#39;ll say here um let&amp;#39;s
28m1s: let&amp;#39;s give it a key you know all all
28m2s: good entities have keys and for those of
28m5s: you thinking what I&amp;#39;m thinking you&amp;#39;re
28m6s: thinking come we come back to that uh
28m9s: key ID um and make it an
28m12s: integer as you can see here what I&amp;#39;m
28m15s: using of course is vs code which is not
28m17s: my normal editor but you know there&amp;#39;s an
28m19s: awesome uh extension for vs code I&amp;#39;m
28m22s: sure you&amp;#39;re all aware but let&amp;#39;s have a
28m23s: look at it uh where is it
28m25s: um in the container it is let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s
28m28s: get rid of the recommended we put that
28m30s: up there like that instead Dev container
28m32s: here we go here we go so inside the dev
28m35s: container I&amp;#39;ve got these things eslint
28m38s: rainbow CSV so we can highlight CSV the
28m40s: rest client okay fine um and sap CDs
28m44s: language
28m45s: support right and it&amp;#39;s the latest
28m48s: version supporting
28m57s: all this uh Intellis sense that&amp;#39;s the
28m59s: Microsoft term isn&amp;#39;t it all this command
29m1s: completion so there we go so let&amp;#39;s save
29m5s: that and now it&amp;#39;s sort of
29m8s: happy so we&amp;#39;ve got a single entity books
29m12s: and the naming convention the cap naming
29m15s: convention for entities is that it
29m17s: should be capitalized capital B plural
29m21s: now this is still a part of me that I
29m25s: know I know that there are reasons why
29m27s: why the convention is to have a for
29m29s: plural entities but there there&amp;#39;s still
29m33s: a small voice in my brain saying should
29m35s: be singular really it just makes more
29m37s: sense logically to me but I don&amp;#39;t you
29m39s: know what do I know I&amp;#39;ve got a small
29m40s: brain so you know so let&amp;#39;s take the cap
29m44s: conventions and use the plural okay uh
29m47s: good day jski yski sorry jski Yi good
29m51s: day uh let&amp;#39;s take the um the plural and
29m53s: let&amp;#39;s have a look over here let&amp;#39;s go
29m54s: over here and refresh it&amp;#39;s already
29m56s: refreshed look at the meage met data you
29m58s: know we all love metadata we love o data
30m1s: metadata XML you know it&amp;#39;s still
30m2s: horrible to look at but going you can
30m4s: read it you can stare at it it&amp;#39;s nicely
30m6s: formatted but there we&amp;#39;ve got we&amp;#39;ve got
30m8s: the entity type books we&amp;#39;ve got our
30m10s: property name id id it&amp;#39;s an INT 32
30m14s: integer integer it can&amp;#39;t be nullable
30m17s: because it&amp;#39;s a key and in fact there&amp;#39;s
30m19s: the there&amp;#39;s the um the XML uh element
30m22s: that is telling us that the key or Keys
30m25s: properties is this one here it&amp;#39;s a
30m26s: reference to that
30m27s: okay so far so good so why don&amp;#39;t we also
30m30s: have there&amp;#39;s no no point having a books
30m32s: entity without a
30m34s: title string okay now
30m38s: notice let&amp;#39;s refresh that there we go
30m41s: notice
30m44s: that we can all
30m46s: restart
30m48s: performing operations on this fully
30m51s: fledged odata service this already is a
30m55s: fully functioning odata service that
30m57s: will that will respond appropriately to
31m1s: create read update delete and query OD
31m5s: dat operations right now we&amp;#39;re of course
31m8s: performing a query operation let me just
31m10s: put that um full screen for a second a
31m12s: quer a query operation an O data query
31m14s: because we&amp;#39;re asking for an entity set
31m17s: on the books
31m18s: entity
31m21s: right now let&amp;#39;s stop there for a second
31m25s: and think well you know it&amp;#39;s not very
31m27s: exciting so let&amp;#39;s add some
31m31s: data the um convention that we I think
31m35s: talked about was that if we
31m39s: create a directory called I mean do this
31m43s: with the keyboard I&amp;#39;ve been trying to
31m44s: learn a bit a few more
31m47s: um a few more keyboard shortcuts in vs
31m49s: code I&amp;#39;m not a vs code user like I keep
31m50s: saying but it is pretty awesome and it
31m53s: has good support for for keyboard users
31m55s: for example I&amp;#39;ve learned the other day
31m56s: that can just you know open and close
31m59s: this sort of you know this this bit here
32m1s: that has the Explorer or the run and
32m3s: debug thing or the extensions I can open
32m4s: and close that with command B John oh
32m7s: John says plural versus singular debate
32m9s: aside I love that is it is an
32m11s: opinionated framework and removes a lot
32m12s: of the inconsistency we use to end up
32m14s: with uh caused by differing developer
32m16s: opinions John I couldn&amp;#39;t have said it
32m18s: better myself this is one of the many
32m21s: things I love about cap it&amp;#39;s an
32m23s: opinionated framework convention over
32m25s: configuration grow as you go all these
32m27s: different things come together to make
32m31s: developers life lives easier and yeah it
32m35s: it sort of removes the debate right this
32m40s: is the opinion this is what it should be
32m43s: it&amp;#39;s almost like you know a
32m46s: philosophical version of um prettier RC
32m50s: you know set of pretti RC rules isn&amp;#39;t it
32m53s: you know or like the gofm you know it
32m55s: will format your go there only one way
32m57s: to format go code for example so you
32m59s: know forget the argument about two
33m1s: spaces four spaces tabs whatever no just
33m3s: do it this way okay so that&amp;#39;s great I
33m5s: love
33m6s: it so let&amp;#39;s give it let&amp;#39;s give ourselves
33m8s: some data let&amp;#39;s go and create a new file
33m11s: um let&amp;#39;s save that file as data I think
33m14s: you can also create directories by sort
33m16s: of you know maybe maybe I don&amp;#39;t know
33m18s: let&amp;#39;s see uh books. CSV let&amp;#39;s see if
33m21s: that works oh there we go oh look the
33m23s: folder data does not exist would you
33m25s: like to create it yes please
33m27s: there we go now we&amp;#39;re in editing a CSV
33m31s: file notice that I&amp;#39;ve created it in a
33m35s: data directory okay so by
33m38s: convention the cap server will
33m42s: look for data to load in sort of design
33m47s: time mode into the entities to serve
33m52s: okay let&amp;#39;s think about the name of this
33m54s: file for shortly uh but if if we put the
33m57s: in the CSV we&amp;#39;ve got ID
34m0s: and uh what&amp;#39;s it called title so let&amp;#39;s
34m2s: have ID one the hit hiker guy to the
34m9s: Galaxy uh to mostly Harless yes and of
34m14s: course these are both Douglas Adams
34m15s: books not in any particular order of
34m17s: course and let&amp;#39;s have another book um I
34m21s: don&amp;#39;t know use of weapons there if
34m25s: anybody knows what that is
34m28s: uh let me know let me know what the who
34m29s: the author is and whether you&amp;#39;ve read it
34m32s: uh absolutely incredibly fantastic book
34m36s: um by a Scottish author there&amp;#39;s a
34m39s: clue so now what cap oh hello what cap
34m43s: will do what the cap server will do is
34m45s: it will look for appropriately
34m49s: named CSV files to load however if we
34m54s: refresh
34m55s: this there&amp;#39;s no data why is that can
34m59s: anybody who anybody who&amp;#39;s familiar with
35m2s: let&amp;#39;s put that over there anybody who&amp;#39;s
35m4s: familiar with the output here and this
35m7s: is why I I always stress on our Cap Code
35m10s: jams that to to know and to love and to
35m14s: see this as you know like know this like
35m16s: the back of your hand you&amp;#39;ll notice
35m18s: things that appear that are not normally
35m21s: there and you&amp;#39;ll notice things that
35m23s: don&amp;#39;t appear that are normally there so
35m26s: I&amp;#39;m noticing right now well let&amp;#39;s go
35m27s: through them loaded model from one file
35m29s: services. CDs great and we also know
35m31s: from the previous episodes
35m34s: why it&amp;#39;s um uh found and loaded
35m38s: automatically without us saying anything
35m40s: services. CDs because that&amp;#39;s one of the
35m41s: two hard-coded file names schema and
35m44s: services alongside the DB app and Sur
35m48s: directories blah blah blah blah blah
35m51s: successfully deployed to inmemory
35m53s: database but in between this log line
35m56s: here
35m58s: and this log line
36m0s: here quite often we
36m4s: see some log lines that talk about
36m6s: loading data from these CSV files but we
36m11s: haven&amp;#39;t got that here even though we&amp;#39;ve
36m13s: got a CSV file books. CSV in a data
36m18s: directory so we&amp;#39;re doing what we think
36m21s: is the right thing so why isn&amp;#39;t the data
36m23s: being
36m24s: loaded so Kiara says Douglas Adams heart
36m28s: yes Douglas Adams DNA his initials were
36m31s: DNA which is quite cool um yeah uh died
36m34s: all too soon at the age of 50 was he in
36m36s: a gym or something in Los Angeles um so
36m39s: yes Douglas Adams wrote uh many books
36m42s: including the hitch of the Galaxy and
36m43s: also mostly
36m44s: harmless but use of weapons does anybody
36m47s: know um does anybody know um uh who
36m51s: wrote use of weapons uh it&amp;#39;s an author
36m53s: that writes under two slightly different
36m55s: names fiction and science fiction use of
36m58s: weapons is science fiction um so oh um
37m2s: uh chakia is that how you pronounce yeah
37m5s: put yes or no uh or you know what
37m7s: something chakia am I pronouncing your
37m9s: name correctly because I know I
37m9s: pronounced it incorrectly previous
37m11s: episode I apologize um so it&amp;#39;s not in
37m14s: the DB folder which is the default
37m15s: directory
37m17s: now that&amp;#39;s interesting shall we put it
37m21s: in the DB folder and find out let&amp;#39;s
37m22s: let&amp;#39;s find out I&amp;#39;m not not going to
37m24s: dismiss that so if we say here uh make
37m27s: the DB and move uh data to
37m32s: DB so
37m35s: now wooo hold on tree um is it oh
37m41s: uh oh that&amp;#39;s not can we ignore ignore
37m44s: ignore ignore pattern tree ignore node
37m48s: modules there we go fine so now we&amp;#39;ve
37m52s: got the books
37m54s: CSV people who know me will know that
37m57s: sort of you know I&amp;#39;m being slightly
37m58s: obtuse and using tree when we&amp;#39;ve got a
38m0s: perfectly sort of acceptable you know
38m2s: tree display here but actually it sort
38m4s: of comp anyway DJ get on with the get on
38m7s: with the program we&amp;#39;ve now got the
38m10s: books. CSV in the data directory in a DB
38m13s: directory let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s see what
38m14s: happens
38m16s: now CDs
38m22s: watch still nothing still nothing so it
38m26s: was a great guess
38m28s: chakia but it&amp;#39;s not quite the reason why
38m32s: we&amp;#39;re not finding this stuff so let me
38m34s: move that back again move DB data to
38m37s: here rmd DB let&amp;#39;s get back to where we
38m40s: were tree there we go so all we&amp;#39;ve now
38m43s: got is a data directory with books. CSV
38m45s: so somnath says hi DJ hi somnath uh do
38m48s: you like to call out CDs ad data
38m51s: features oh that&amp;#39;s a yes and also John
38m54s: Murray says great Point excellent
38m55s: feature uh uh oh chakia thank you thank
38m58s: you for the confirmation um why not move
39m1s: it to test data okay we&amp;#39;ll try that in a
39m3s: minute fer so um what somnath is
39m6s: referring to CDs ad right so CDs ad is a
39m11s: facility which we did play around with
39m13s: very briefly in episode two CDs ad d-el
39m17s: let&amp;#39;s move this in fact let&amp;#39;s move this
39m20s: up there there we go help help help help
39m22s: help add CSV headers for modeled
39m25s: entities okay we&amp;#39;ll do that for the next
39m29s: entity okay in fact no let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s
39m31s: um what happened there um let&amp;#39;s do that
39m35s: now let&amp;#39;s see what happens um RM data
39m40s: books going type it in quickly again
39m41s: right CDs add
39m44s: data right there we go uh and I think
39m49s: this might help us with the answer to
39m51s: the
39m53s: question there we go there we go
39m57s: brilliant uh so oh sorry fuler and um
40m0s: yes so fuler is also saying and the
40m2s: thing I was trying to get to so Suna
40m5s: well done for suggesting something
40m7s: that&amp;#39;s beautifully subtly going to tell
40m9s: us the answer without telling us the
40m11s: answer showing us another example of the
40m14s: awesome CDs ad
40m17s: feature
40m19s: and again showing us the convention over
40m24s: configuration and the opinionated nature
40m26s: of cap what has it
40m30s: done let me let me remove the data
40m34s: directory now for a
40m37s: second what it&amp;#39;s done is create because
40m42s: because conventionally it likes having a
40m45s: DB
40m46s: directory conventionally as we&amp;#39;ve sort
40m49s: of talked about it knows to look for
40m52s: data in CSV files in a directory called
40m59s: data and it will look for and use CSV
41m4s: records for
41m7s: entities as long as or not as long as if
41m11s: it finds that data in files that are
41m15s: named a specific way why did what did I
41m18s: name the file I named the file books.
41m20s: CSV with a capital B and that&amp;#39;s sort of
41m22s: you know that makes sense because it&amp;#39;s
41m24s: the books entity
41m27s: however however however however things
41m30s: as we&amp;#39;ll see in the next episode next
41m32s: week start to get quite complex oh
41m36s: sorry ignore that
41m40s: rewind this is the simplest thing that
41m42s: could possibly work we&amp;#39;ve got this
41m43s: really you know super super super simple
41m47s: deliberately simple books entity but as
41m50s: soon as you start doing things that will
41m52s: be useful in the Enterprise you&amp;#39;re going
41m54s: have multiple entities you might have
41m55s: multiple teams building these entity
41m57s: definitions using Services pulling
41m59s: things in from Left Right and uh Center
42m2s: so you want to manage these definitions
42m5s: through name spaces through
42m9s: prefixes so what&amp;#39;s happened here is that
42m12s: it&amp;#39;s created the file but see what it&amp;#39;s
42m14s: called Bookshop do books.
42m18s: CSV okay where does this
42m22s: Bookshop prefix of file name come in
42m25s: from
42m27s: the service name so we&amp;#39;ve got an books
42m30s: entity in the Bookshop service so the
42m33s: file name should be for loading data
42m36s: into this entity Bookshop do books or
42m40s: Bookshop Das books. CSV oh my goodness
42m42s: so much chat fantastic uh fer says might
42m45s: not move it to test data well I think I
42m47s: think we&amp;#39;re okay for that now and
42m48s: include the fitting prefix that was the
42m50s: more the more uh important part um so we
42m54s: need a schema I ah so Johnny is saying
42m57s: we need a schema and name space although
42m58s: it&amp;#39;s probably showing my cat Ruster hey
43m1s: no capat rusters here allowed in fact
43m3s: take my jump off cuz it&amp;#39;s really warm
43m4s: now one
43m6s: second and while I take my jumper off
43m8s: I&amp;#39;m going to see if I can read I need my
43m10s: glasses to read that it&amp;#39;s a bit small
43m12s: there we go yes there we go um so Phil K
43m16s: oh Phil I&amp;#39;ve not even read your sentence
43m18s: yet but I love the I did not understand
43m20s: I did understand the reference to
43m21s: opinionated but I think this helps to
43m23s: explain it oh okay okay yes opinionated
43m26s: a framework that&amp;#39;s another example of an
43m28s: opinionated framework and I think I&amp;#39;ve
43m29s: used this example before is rails it has
43m32s: opinions um I think partly because it&amp;#39;s
43m35s: Creator David hin my Hansen has opinions
43m37s: which is
43m39s: great um and rather than I use this
43m43s: example yester yesterday day before
43m45s: yesterday in warsa in the code Jam
43m46s: someone was talking about opinions and
43m48s: stuff and and opinionated Frameworks and
43m50s: configuration and having to do either no
43m52s: configuration or loads of configuration
43m54s: before you even start I remember figh in
43m56s: with j2e and you had to configure the
43m59s: heck out of everything before you even
44m1s: got you know got off the start line okay
44m4s: so that was a very unopinionated
44m6s: framework but an opinionated framework
44m8s: it has opinions as to how you should do
44m10s: things that goes hand inand with
44m13s: therefore having conventions such that
44m17s: if you don&amp;#39;t say anything it&amp;#39;s going to
44m18s: do things in a certain way that&amp;#39;s what
44m20s: that
44m21s: means um uh is it is it opinion or put
44m24s: the fin here well actually um put the
44m27s: file here if you want to not have to
44m29s: lift a finger this is this is a really
44m31s: good discussion
44m33s: so an opinionated framework with
44m36s: conventions in this cap case means that
44m40s: if you follow caps opinions if you agree
44m43s: with them and follow those conventions
44m45s: that it&amp;#39;s expecting you to follow then
44m48s: things magic will happen without you
44m51s: doing
44m52s: anything for example remember last week
44m57s: and in fact
44m58s: here uh in the hello world remember the
45m1s: hello world you know it told us to
45m4s: create this world. CDs in the serve
45m8s: directory to define a service called say
45m11s: with a function in it and then it told
45m13s: us to create a file called world. JS
45m16s: also in the serve directory okay with
45m19s: the
45m20s: implementation of that service so that
45m23s: the function could be you know
45m25s: implemented
45m28s: in nowhere in here did we have to
45m31s: specify explicitly oh the implementation
45m35s: for this service is in this file it&amp;#39;s
45m38s: implicit because it&amp;#39;s after that
45m41s: convention the opinion is that if you
45m43s: put a file a JS file next to a CDS file
45m47s: of the same name in the same directory
45m48s: it&amp;#39;s going to use that as its
45m51s: implementation right does that make
45m53s: sense yes exactly if you abide by the
45m56s: opinions it is a massive helper okay
45m58s: John Murray says I&amp;#39;ve just realized
46m0s: where we&amp;#39;re matching fleeces John Murray
46m2s: excellent uh probably not allowed to
46m4s: name the um the store but uh uh you um I
46m8s: will go there again uh next time I go
46m12s: Outdoors uh so uh I think that&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re
46m15s: going to be talking about excellent so
46m17s: um uh so am I catching all this chat
46m22s: here um Stefano says how easy it is how
46m25s: easy is it to connect to other databases
46m27s: as apart from SQL light and Han cloud
46m29s: postgress my SQL pretty damn easy um so
46m33s: for example if we have a look at npm and
46m38s: uh cap uh
46m41s: postgress ql let&amp;#39;s have a look post post
46m44s: postgressql
46m51s: um post press ql where is
46m54s: it uh CDs post cql I can&amp;#39;t find it uh oh
47m0s: CDs CDs post cql
47m4s: H well let&amp;#39;s just go stra let&amp;#39;s just go
47m6s: straight to it
47m8s: um cap JS post
47m12s: ql where is it what&amp;#39;s going on what&amp;#39;s
47m15s: going on with my brain cap uh
47m17s: postgressql uh
47m22s: npm capture oh postest not postest ql dj
47m26s: brain
47m27s: okay so basically this is all you
47m31s: need to install the drivers for postest
47m35s: for example thank you Nico this 13-hour
47m39s: Journey yesterday has just completely
47m41s: addled my brain I apologize so we go let
47m43s: me just share that uh in there there we
47m46s: go fantastic okay cool by the way I&amp;#39;m
47m49s: monitoring the performance of the uh the
47m52s: the container the docker container
47m54s: called wonderful m
47m57s: uh that is the container in that we
47m59s: connect to vs code in fact we can see it
48m1s: there remote Explorer um there we go cap
48m4s: B2B main that&amp;#39;s this one here wonderful
48m6s: M there we go anyway so a random um get
48m10s: back to there so where were we Okay so
48m12s: we&amp;#39;ve now got a file called Bookshop
48m14s: books CSV CDs watch if we start up CDs
48m19s: watch now what we
48m22s: get is this record here that again
48m26s: if you Embrace and stare at and grow to
48m29s: love the output from the cap server
48m32s: you&amp;#39;ll have noticed that you know there
48m34s: was something missing and now it&amp;#39;s there
48m36s: in it from DB datab Bookshop do books
48m39s: CSV so now when we go across here and
48m41s: press refresh hopefully
48m44s: what what what what what what what what
48m48s: books what&amp;#39;s going on oh
48m52s: ah of course I&amp;#39;ve deleted the data idiot
48m56s: DJ
48m58s: so uh no let&amp;#39;s do that uh close that
49m2s: without saving don&amp;#39;t save so let&amp;#39;s go
49m4s: and put some data in there again DB data
49m7s: Bookshop book CSV ID title ID
49m10s: one the pitch I had it there I could
49m14s: have copy pasted it
49m15s: hikers to the Galaxy let&amp;#39;s just save
49m19s: that one there we go and um refresh
49m22s: there we go there it is okay let&amp;#39;s add
49m23s: another one um two who mostly harmless
49m28s: just to give you another clue as to who
49m29s: this other author might be let&amp;#39;s do
49m31s: another one of his books um uh the
49m33s: player of games anybody tell who that is
49m37s: come on the player of games
49m40s: now in it from DB data refresh there we
49m44s: go now haven&amp;#39;t even start look it&amp;#39;s 8:47
49m48s: already but this
49m51s: is brilliant conversation oh MTS hi MTS
49m54s: I might have missed this but wanted to
49m56s: know what does module exports actually
49m58s: do great question great question now
50m1s: we&amp;#39;ve got rid of the service
50m2s: implementation here but let&amp;#39;s go back to
50m3s: the documentation here you are referring
50m6s: to this right
50m10s: so module exports is a a
50m16s: nodejs package or module management
50m20s: mechanism so imagine you have you know
50m22s: regardless of language you know python
50m24s: Pearl Java script
50m28s: whatever and you have want to build a
50m32s: library a module a package that has a
50m36s: series of functions that you want to
50m38s: expose to the the users of that package
50m41s: you know you might have things uh that
50m43s: are internal to that package functions
50m44s: that are internal to that package and
50m46s: you might have functions that you want
50m47s: that that package to expose so when
50m48s: people import that package they can you
50m50s: know get a reference to the the function
50m53s: and start using it the functions or the
50m57s: entities that&amp;#39;s not dj don&amp;#39;t use the
50m59s: word entities the
51m1s: things in that package that you&amp;#39;re
51m3s: creating that you want to expose you
51m5s: want to make available to the consumers
51m7s: of your
51m9s: package you expose
51m12s: by making them available through this
51m18s: special property called
51m21s: exports module. exports Okay so that&amp;#39;s
51m25s: what it&amp;#39;s for it&amp;#39;s
51m27s: basically a way of making stuff in a
51m31s: module available to the consumers so
51m34s: sides says that in a much better way
51m37s: than I could in a one sentence way to
51m39s: expose the function to outside the JS
51m41s: file perfect okay now I hear you ask
51m46s: what happens if I&amp;#39;ve got more than one
51m47s: function because you know this is just
51m48s: exposing one thing is exposing a an an
51m52s: an anonymous
51m53s: function but what you you can also do is
51m57s: the value you can assign to the exports
52m0s: property can be an object okay so you
52m3s: have multiple things in that object
52m5s: obviously okay brilliant so where were
52m7s: we get rid of that get rid of that get
52m9s: rid of that and go back to
52m12s: here just to prove that it doesn&amp;#39;t need
52m15s: to be in the DB in the DB directory um
52m18s: make the data oh in fact um move DB data
52m22s: to here and rmd DB
52m27s: uh
52m29s: tree there we go so we&amp;#39;ve now moved it
52m32s: up one level okay so we got for the
52m34s: moment I want to sort of keep away from
52m37s: the DB ser and app directories and do
52m39s: the simplest thing that could possibly
52m41s: work okay uh so CDs
52m45s: watch and we&amp;#39;re still getting that thing
52m47s: loaded okay refresh there it is and in
52m50s: fact also move data thingy to data but
52m54s: what you all also see quite a lot is a
52m57s: dash there books.
52m59s: CSV DJ you idiot um more Hast less speed
53m4s: let&amp;#39;s just fix that how do you how do
53m6s: you rename it in vs code CSV not dsv
53m10s: CSV CDs
53m14s: watch there we go still works okay so
53m17s: ints you&amp;#39;re welcome um oh Sid I like
53m20s: that
53m23s: Sid now you know what I&amp;#39;m sort of well
53m27s: I&amp;#39;m going to apologize I had so many
53m29s: things planned for this so uh I wanted
53m31s: to cover um you know we still got eight
53m34s: nine minutes left but I wanted to cover
53m35s: you know a
53m36s: second a second uh entity and an
53m39s: association a managing Association and
53m41s: then moving the stuff to out to outside
53m44s: of the service definition itself but we
53m45s: can you know let me know please let me
53m48s: know in the chat type something in the
53m49s: chat right now to tell me whether you
53m53s: prefer this conversation
53m56s: style and we don&amp;#39;t get that far or
53m58s: whether you want to go faster when you
54m0s: can move not go faster but move forward
54m3s: and cover more ground in a quicker way
54m6s: let me know please let me know in the
54m7s: chat because you know I I never know
54m8s: whether this is just
54m10s: like obv too obvious but um you know or
54m13s: what so let me know so we&amp;#39;ve got that
54m16s: here we got that there so let&amp;#39;s go back
54m18s: to our services of
54m20s: CDs tell you what let&amp;#39;s define oh by the
54m23s: way yeah so um what that did by the way
54m25s: the CDs ad so we got completely
54m27s: distracted the CDs ad data that was a
54m30s: brilliant suggestion from somebody up
54m32s: there I can&amp;#39;t I can&amp;#39;t scroll up to find
54m34s: out uh what that did was create this
54m36s: file
54m38s: with the first record the head record so
54m41s: it worked out that you know ID and
54m44s: title so Stefan says conversation Style
54m47s: with behind the scenes inside are
54m48s: appreciated thank you Stefan and Matias
54m50s: conversation style is perfect oh great
54m51s: okay thank you thank you um so that&amp;#39;s
54m55s: good to
54m56s: know why don&amp;#39;t we which one should we do
55m0s: which one should we do in this time
55m1s: available okay let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s create a
55m2s: second entity because you
55m7s: know uh yeah okay I know yeah we can use
55m11s: this to learn about aspects maybe we can
55m14s: cover aspects what do you reckon faler
55m15s: and Nico and everybody um oh what&amp;#39;s
55m17s: going on oh Google&amp;#39;s go away Google hom
55m20s: phone
55m21s: um uh stop what&amp;#39;s going on there uh
55m25s: entity authors key that&amp;#39;s an author has
55m27s: an ID as well key
55m28s: [Music]
55m29s: id id and that&amp;#39;s also let&amp;#39;s have an
55m32s: integer and an author&amp;#39;s got a name right
55m34s: that&amp;#39;ll do
55m36s: string I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve typed one word
55m38s: correctly here okay
55m42s: so now if we go back here
55m48s: refresh there&amp;#39;s no surprise there
55m50s: right&amp;#39;s my my head&amp;#39;s at the bottom cool
55m52s: there&amp;#39;s no surprise there so we have
55m54s: book books great and we have authors
55m58s: great and you know we&amp;#39;ve got no data
55m59s: there right um so why don&amp;#39;t we
56m2s: add C uh data
56m6s: Bookshop authors. CSV let&amp;#39;s add into
56m10s: their um ID and name and we&amp;#39;ll have now
56m16s: just bear with me just for the purposes
56m19s: of us having this super
56m23s: simple service super simple Service uh
56m27s: with you know simple entities and simple
56m29s: data let&amp;#39;s not do really complex IDs
56m32s: let&amp;#39;s just have things that sort of make
56m34s: sense so when we see like 101 we know
56m36s: it&amp;#39;s an author you know in the 100
56m37s: series when we see one two3 as a book
56m39s: you know it just helps my small brain so
56m41s: 101
56m43s: Douglas Noel Adams there we go that&amp;#39;s
56m45s: what the n stands for and 102 nobody
56m48s: said any nobody&amp;#39;s guessed what uh who
56m50s: the author of uh player of games and use
56m52s: of weapons and and the the general
56m54s: culture series John Murray I thought you
56m56s: might know what that is seems the sort
56m58s: of book you you quite enjoy the series
57m0s: you quite enjoy uh so some the topic is
57m2s: back to basic slow and steady is what I
57m4s: think is needed Som great comment thank
57m6s: you yes concepts are important here not
57m7s: building a brilliant app I believe Som
57m10s: thank you yes aspect for the win yes uh
57m13s: AP says I would like to be a little
57m15s: faster okay so well you know
57m19s: just so Shas hello DJ hello Shas in
57m22s: India fantastic welcome so and the
57m25s: person is Ian M
57m29s: Banks he writes under the name Ian Banks
57m32s: when he writes fiction but when he
57m33s: writes science fiction he has the m in
