4m48s: sap Tech head the sap Tech virtual and
4m50s: the sort of the follow on events as well
4m52s: and also the way that this year Dev
4m54s: toober Fest wraps around two weeks
4m56s: before teched two week uh then teched
4m59s: virtual week and then um two weeks after
5m2s: wraps around the tech virtual event so

5m8s: so the latest task how many I can see
5m11s: some folks in here recognize obviously
5m13s: I&amp;#39;ve mentioned Sudan uh that are aware
5m15s: of and are participating in the uh this
5m19s: month&amp;#39;s sap uh developer challenge the
5m22s: latest task the fourth task task number
5m24s: three obviously um is out came out
5m27s: yesterday you know it&amp;#39;s a fairly easy
5m29s: one um and so if you if you have not had
5m32s: a look at this already I would strongly
5m33s: encourage you to do so uh because I

5m54s: good morning Nasim to you in India
5m56s: amazing so that&amp;#39;s that there&amp;#39;s a link
5m59s: there as well There&amp;#39;s the link there um
6m1s: latest task and everything by the way
6m4s: another thing came out um where is a
6m6s: link here the uh we&amp;#39;re doing these
6m8s: YouTube shorts uh sort of you know to
6m11s: consume on your mobile phone um and we
6m15s: we pushed out one on Wednesday two days
6m18s: ago all about the reppel because we on
6m20s: the on the live stream here we know
6m22s: about the reppel we&amp;#39;ve you know taking
6m24s: our first foot
6m25s: footsteps
6m27s: um uh in the repple and everything we
6m29s: might even be using it today who knows
6m31s: who knows so check the playlist out uh
6m34s: the latest one is this one that came out
6m36s: um Wednesday like I say and finally what
6m39s: was the last thing oh no um we&amp;#39;re going
6m41s: to be looking at we I think we looked at
6m42s: this last week or week
6m44s: before this is probably this um this
6m48s: querying in JavaScript is probably what
6m52s: we&amp;#39;re going to want to refer to if we do
6m54s: need to refer to anything during the
6m56s: course of this live stream because this
6m58s: is all about um constructing and making
7m3s: queries that&amp;#39;s of course you know select
7m5s: insert update upsert delete
7m8s: Etc um not in not directly in cql
7m14s: remember remember not directly in
7m18s: um uh cor query language or CDs query
7m21s: language but
7m23s: in the sort of the mini the sort of the
7m25s: the micro language the within node.js
7m29s: within JavaScript so this is using cdsq
7m32s: right cdql take look on constructing
7m34s: queries right we&amp;#39;ve been doing that
7m35s: select do from do columns do where do
7m39s: whatever okay so that&amp;#39;s a reference to
7m42s: that there so let&amp;#39;s get on with it um
7m45s: also also uh before I say let&amp;#39;s get on
7m49s: with it and then digress again
7m51s: um put in the chat as well whether you
7m54s: because Andrew Barnard um who is also a
7m57s: a good friend of this channel uh and
7m59s: good friend of this uh this show hands
8m1s: onb Dev show um said in the uh oh yeah
8m4s: let me let me show you let me go to the
8m6s: thing here um latest task I can get to
8m10s: the lat go to the latest task URL here
8m12s: which is a discussion thread on the
8m15s: community platform but then also there&amp;#39;s
8m17s: always at the top of the task is a link
8m19s: to the main challenge blog post uh which
8m24s: describes all you know the whole thing
8m26s: and then I said at the bottom here um
8m28s: something like oh DJ you write a lot of
8m31s: rubbish don&amp;#39;t you
8m33s: um um let me know in the comments if
8m36s: you&amp;#39;d like to see the request test
8m37s: script and Andrew at the bottom said uh
8m40s: yes I would like to see your request
8m41s: test script in the blog post so maybe we
8m43s: should look at that here because it
8m44s: might be easier to show you here first
8m46s: of all let me know if you want to see
8m47s: the request testing which is the
8m49s: mechanism I use uh let&amp;#39;s open another
8m51s: and go to the um 20
8m55s: 2407 uh there we go there and in here we
8m59s: in in the no I&amp;#39;m doing the sample thing
9m2s: I&amp;#39;ve got this request test mechanism
9m4s: okay
9m5s: um uh testing test no uh CD sample this
9m10s: I&amp;#39;m playing along with you for example I
9m12s: can say testing remote request test and
9m16s: I can do all sorts of test right okay
9m18s: anyway if you want to see that let me
9m20s: know um right so let&amp;#39;s just check
9m23s: everything&amp;#39;s okay yes everything seems
9m24s: to be okay amazing so let&amp;#39;s start um

10m2s: make me jealous then fantastic AJ good
10m4s: morning my my lovely friend and
10m5s: colleague AJ in India okay where we left
10m9s: left off last
10m11s: week I&amp;#39;m looking at my watch I always
10m13s: check the time with my watch here and I
10m15s: put it under my screen but it&amp;#39;s quite
10m17s: dark under there I can&amp;#39;t see the bit
10m19s: there so I can see it there we go it&amp;#39;s
10m22s: just in the bit of light there 810 there
10m24s: we go 810 can you make video on media
10m26s: file
10m26s: handling um uh
10m30s: are you talking about the attachment for
10m31s: example maybe in the future I mean at
10m33s: the moment we&amp;#39;re trying to I&amp;#39;m trying to
10m34s: push through the the Back to Basics this
10m37s: all sorts of um ideas that we could uh
10m40s: cover uh in cap but it&amp;#39;s probably going
10m43s: to be realistically speaking it&amp;#39;s
10m45s: probably going to be next year now that
10m47s: we
10m48s: do uh you know point point coverage of
10m51s: specific things because you&amp;#39;ve got a lot
10m53s: of other things a lot of other cool
10m54s: things planned for you eador Freddy good
10m58s: morning to you in oh my goodness me this
11m0s: by the way did you do you know uh anyway
11m4s: I&amp;#39;m going to digress even more so
11m6s: welcome Freddy welcome friend do you
11m8s: know did you know right so let me just
11m10s: uh collapse that uh sorry change there
11m13s: we go
11m14s: fine right so um we&amp;#39;ve got this whole
11m18s: idea here that where we we start here
11m20s: and then say um list
11m23s: listening oh yes what I one thing I did
11m26s: do I think
11m27s: offline is I use here which curl Jason I
11m32s: use a little mechanism
11m34s: here Jason um to basically invoke curl
11m40s: with all the parameters and you know it
11m44s: puts silent on because you know I like
11m46s: it nice and quiet and then invokes JQ to
11m50s: pretty print it okay so um I I thought
11m53s: I&amp;#39;d bring that in here as well I&amp;#39;m not
11m54s: sure whether I&amp;#39;ve saved it into the uh
11m57s: into the uh uh container definition into
12m1s: the dock uh container image definition
12m4s: but basically I&amp;#39;ve got C if I say curl
12m8s: um and then Local Host 404 o data V4
12m14s: Book
12m15s: Shop books for example I get that but if
12m18s: I say curl Jason I get that okay so what
12m22s: I what I you know where is that which C
12m27s: Jason oh yeah I put it in my big
12m29s: directory maybe I should move let me
12m30s: know if you want this in the uh in the
12m32s: docker container as well maybe I should
12m34s: put that in there um so sashan says oh
12m37s: thank you for commenting yes attachment
12m39s: says nazim okay yes um I mean um I was
12m43s: thinking of getting some people on to
12m44s: talk about their own uh plugins that
12m46s: they&amp;#39;ve written and everything so maybe
12m47s: we can include that in that anyway
12m49s: sashan says honestly this is the first
12m50s: time I&amp;#39;m participating in the dev
12m51s: Challenge and all credit goes to this
12m53s: back to basic series here the hints in
12m54s: the task description are quite helpful
12m56s: thank you sashan thank you very much yes
12m58s: so if if You&amp;#39; not uh if you&amp;#39;re not
13m0s: participating in the dev challenges
13m2s: particularly this one this month for
13m3s: example uh get going what are you
13m5s: waiting for um so let&amp;#39;s move that up
13m7s: there so what we&amp;#39;ll do uh is we&amp;#39;ll say
13m10s: list uh C uh list listening and send
13m15s: that into ENT I should really sort of
13m18s: alas this shouldn&amp;#39;t I as well enter c
13m23s: um uh curl
13m25s: Jason local poost 40004 o data V4 books
13m31s: oh yeah no
13m33s: Bookshop books now we started looking
13m37s: at uh an individual book to get the
13m39s: stock value so let&amp;#39;s start where we left
13m41s: off last week which was let&amp;#39;s just bring
13m43s: up uh for example here
13m46s: 404 let&amp;#39;s look at the books and just
13m49s: grab um there we go the player of games
13m52s: the ID the guid of um let&amp;#39;s get rid of
13m56s: that get rid of all the stuff we don&amp;#39;t
13m58s: want here do like challenge fine okay
14m1s: there and put the ID in now we can
14m3s: either put it in Brackets there like
14m5s: that uh let&amp;#39;s do that for example or of
14m9s: course we can use the the alternative uh
14m12s: way of expressing that which is just to
14m14s: sort of have it as part of the path okay
14m17s: we can do that
14m18s: right but what we want to do really is
14m21s: say stock value remember stock
14m24s: value is if we look at here um what&amp;#39;s it
14m27s: called um main
14m30s: CDs we Define stock
14m33s: value as a bound function not as an
14m37s: Unbound function not like total stock
14m39s: but as a bound function therefore it
14m41s: goes into this actions Clause that&amp;#39;s
14m43s: stuck on the end of the books in this
14m46s: case entity definition here in this in
14m48s: this in the
14m50s: service okay so let&amp;#39;s just run that now
14m53s: let&amp;#39;s go back to here and run that and
14m55s: at the
14m56s: moment um we get 42 because of course
14m59s: you know we ended on a high or on a low
15m2s: we ended on life the universe and
15m3s: everything the answer to um with saying
15m6s: let&amp;#39;s just do the simplest thing that
15m7s: could possibly work okay 42
15m11s: now we also had a look ah yeah this is
15m13s: where we want to look at the oh
15m16s: something else actually param stock ID
15m19s: um actions functions let&amp;#39;s go to cap
15m22s: let&amp;#39;s go to capire um
15m25s: actions uh implementing actions and
15m27s: functions and what we saw somewhere
15m30s: there we go there we go we saw this last
15m32s: this do on get stock F blah blah blah we
15m35s: copied that didn&amp;#39;t we we copied that
15m38s: here so we have a reference and that&amp;#39;s
15m40s: right yes it&amp;#39;s all coming back to me
15m41s: like a bad
15m42s: dream we said we go and make sure
15m45s: everybody under everybody
15m48s: understood what is going on here in this
15m53s: destructuring so we&amp;#39;ll do that first but
15m56s: to understand where this destructuring
15m58s: comes in and why we need well we don&amp;#39;t
16m0s: need the destruction we can do it a
16m2s: different
16m3s: way but let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s make sure we
16m6s: understand what&amp;#39;s in the documentation
16m9s: so when we read the documentation we
16m10s: don&amp;#39;t think oh my goodness me what&amp;#39;s
16m12s: that mean what even
16m13s: mean um
16m16s: and yes I tell you what we&amp;#39;ll do tell
16m18s: you what we&amp;#39;ll
16m19s: do we
16m22s: know let&amp;#39;s just do the equivalent do the
16m25s: equivalent but in a code block that we
16m27s: have to use the return for example and
16m30s: then there oh by the way oh ah missing
16m33s: what hello what ah oh yes missing a
16m35s: close bracket before I press Save By the
16m38s: way before I press save you see it&amp;#39;s
16m39s: still unsaved and therefore the cap
16m42s: server is not restarted notice are you
16m45s: thinking why is the date here so I can
16m48s: just keep an eye on when the request was
16m51s: made okay just to prove to myself that
16m53s: yeah this is this is a request that&amp;#39;s
16m54s: just happened now cuz it&amp;#39;s 8 816 817 now
16m58s: this is UTC time so it&amp;#39;s 7:17 now so if
17m1s: I press save I know that the cap Ser
17m4s: will restart and something will happen
17m7s: it&amp;#39;s restarting nice and slowly there we
17m8s: go perfect because I&amp;#39;m running
17m9s: containers and blah blah blah and all
17m11s: sorts of things but now I can look at
17m13s: this and think ah yeah that is that is
17m15s: literally now you know a a new call
17m18s: right that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the reason I got the
17m20s: day there
17m22s: um so I&amp;#39;ve just included it in a block
17m26s: here so that we can find out
17m30s: what this is all about because given now
17m32s: we got this on a separate line we got
17m34s: break point there and we&amp;#39;ve used um
17m37s: debugging before haven&amp;#39;t we so i s I
17m40s: suggest let me know in the comments if
17m41s: you think this is a good idea I suggest
17m45s: we get a feel for what comes in in the
17m51s: request when we make a call to a bound
17m57s: function not an Unbound fun function but
17m59s: a bound function and therefore let me
18m1s: just um just kill up for a second there
18m4s: we go therefore because what we going to
18m6s: need to do is figure out all right to
18m8s: what book entity is this stock value
18m12s: function bound yeah and obviously the
18m16s: answer is this one with this guid right
18m21s: so let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s go slowly and figure out
18m25s: how we get there so what we&amp;#39;ll do is
18m27s: we&amp;#39;ll stop the cap server
18m29s: we&amp;#39;ll start the
18m33s: debugger is that small that&amp;#39;s a bit
18m35s: small isn&amp;#39;t it there we go that&amp;#39;s a bit
18m36s: better isn&amp;#39;t
18m37s: it um start the debugger and immediately
18m41s: we we hit this particular return 42
18m44s: because of course while we&amp;#39;ve stopped
18m47s: the the cap server we&amp;#39;re still running
18m49s: this listen this still running this
18m51s: listening which was going to reinvoke
18m53s: the curl command so the Cur command has
18m55s: gone and done the call to the stock
18m58s: value use bound function on that
19m0s: particular book which is which one is it
19m2s: the player of games I think uh yeah the
19m3s: player of games 3B
19m6s: 1e okay now where&amp;#39;s the Deb
19m11s: console what we can see here is that the
19m16s: request basically what we&amp;#39;ll find out is
19m18s: the request holds everything that we
19m21s: need I&amp;#39;m just going to go to there make
19m22s: sure everything&amp;#39;s okay yeah everything&amp;#39;s
19m23s: okay the the request um this is the this
19m27s: is a disadvantage of having only one
19m29s: main
19m29s: screen um I would normally have my sort
19m32s: of what&amp;#39;s it
19m34s: called streamlabs and YouTube live
19m36s: streaming thing uh on a separate monitor
19m39s: but I&amp;#39;m got a separate monitor go so the
19m43s: subscriber good morning Adam my name is
19m45s: not Adam my name is DJ or qro um I&amp;#39;m
19m48s: getting ready for the associate
19m49s: certification cap backend developer yes
19m51s: good work the
19m54s: subscriber um so oh yeah so what we can
19m58s: do is hover over that in the debugger
20m0s: inv vs code very nice and see lots of
20m2s: things here but sometimes you know the
20m3s: sort of hover thing goes away so I can
20m5s: use this and say right click add to
20m8s: watch and then we can see it here about
20m11s: one
20m13s: bigger now just going back here and
20m16s: putting putting this in our
20m18s: brain this on get stock Fu we understand
20m22s: that this is the actual event right this
20m25s: is our un the our bound function name
20m28s: this is The Entity to which this called
20m32s: event is bound Fu or in our case of
20m36s: course
20m38s: um books okay so we got the stock value
20m42s: bound to
20m44s: books then we got this thing here params
20m46s: where does pams come in well if we have
20m49s: a
20m50s: look inside of the request the incoming
20m53s: request which of course as we know from
20m55s: having looked at this before in on
20m57s: handlers the first argument that&amp;#39;s
21m0s: passed is the request is the incoming
21m4s: request so we&amp;#39;ve captured that argument
21m6s: in this parameter called Rec which is
21m9s: you know convention request is req and
21m12s: response is Rees right convention
21m17s: wise so if we have a look inside of
21m19s: what&amp;#39;s inside of what&amp;#39;s in inside
21m22s: request we see all these underscore
21m23s: things now I&amp;#39;ll skip over these
21m26s: underscore all these all these
21m28s: properties let&amp;#39;s call them properties
21m29s: for now
21m30s: whatever what is the key thing to
21m33s: remember about anything that begins with
21m35s: an underscore in cap and in many other
21m38s: libraries and Frameworks as well put in
21m40s: the
21m41s: chat what the underscore here
21m45s: signifies but if we while we while
21m47s: you&amp;#39;re putting that in the chat if we
21m49s: scroll down here we see all sorts of
21m51s: things so we can see for example query
21m53s: we can look at that we can you know
21m55s: Target let&amp;#39;s look at Target rec. Target
21m59s: okay so we get Bookshop books Bookshop
22m2s: books is the target there&amp;#39;s the there&amp;#39;s
22m4s: the sort of the name space the service
22m5s: name underscore books Rec do what was
22m7s: the other one we we&amp;#39;re looking at query
22m9s: query rec. query okay anyway all sorts
22m12s: of different things chakia says uh in I
22m15s: think in response to what does the
22m16s: underscore signify custom
22m19s: parameter not that wasn&amp;#39;t the answer I
22m22s: was thinking of somebody else put in the
22m25s: chat what the underscoring these things
22m28s: here here signifies to us as developers
22m30s: to us as users of the
22m34s: framework remember here the context is
22m37s: that we&amp;#39;re looking into
22m39s: the behind the curtain at cap into the
22m42s: bowels of cap to understand what&amp;#39;s going
22m44s: on but now while we while while somebody
22m47s: else puts on or maybe chaki puts a
22m49s: different answer there let&amp;#39;s have a look
22m50s: at pams rick.
22m54s: params check it out now let me make that
22m57s: one bigger as well because you know we
23m0s: can do that what do we see here rec.
23m3s: params is an array of
23m8s: one value if we expand that we can just
23m11s: basically see a little bit more about
23m13s: that array object
23m16s: right but we can see that this is an
23m19s: array of values and this value 3 b1e is
23m24s: exactly what we&amp;#39;re looking for so that
23m26s: is where we get
23m30s: where is it that is where we
23m32s: get the guey the ID of the particular
23m37s: entity to which this particular instance
23m40s: of the stock value function is being is
23m43s: called right so we can say rec.
23m46s: prams and then go for the first one
23m49s: right uh first one as in the zeroth one
23m53s: and that is what we need in order to go
23m55s: and look that up to go and do a select
24m0s: with um not providing services with
24m3s: let&amp;#39;s go let&amp;#39;s go from here so we know
24m4s: where I&amp;#39;m going from here um
24m7s: with I hear echoing here is it echoing
24m10s: with the select okay where in the where
24m13s: Clause right so we&amp;#39;ll do that
24m16s: shortly okay so nobody&amp;#39;s put in the chat
24m18s: what they think it means uh by the way
24m21s: you know don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t worry about
24m22s: thinking you might get it wrong or
24m23s: anything I was going to say there&amp;#39;s no
24m25s: wrong answers but you know we learn by
24m27s: asking question questions and and
24m29s: providing answers to other questions oh
24m30s: rrick says thank you r underscore equals
24m32s: nameing convention for members of ah
24m34s: members of JS object
24m36s: um it&amp;#39;s a
24m38s: convention but it&amp;#39;s not again what I&amp;#39;m
24m41s: looking for what I&amp;#39;m looking for the
24m43s: answer is that these anything beginning
24m46s: with let me just collapse that one and
24m48s: collapse that one see see a bit more
24m50s: anything beginning with underscore is
24m53s: What&amp;#39;s the phrase I&amp;#39;m looking for uh now
24m55s: I&amp;#39;ve said this What&amp;#39;s the phrase I&amp;#39;m
24m56s: looking for is sort of
24m59s: we shouldn&amp;#39;t use them they&amp;#39;re private
25m2s: okay we shouldn&amp;#39;t rely on it these are
25m5s: sort of inner workings of the mechanism
25m8s: that we&amp;#39;re looking at okay so it&amp;#39;s not
25m11s: public it&amp;#39;s private it&amp;#39;s just a
25m14s: convention so if we started writing
25m16s: writing a Handler for example that
25m18s: relied upon something in wreck that was
25m21s: something
25m24s: underscore we should think again because
25m27s: that might change that&amp;#39;s basically
25m30s: signifying this is part of the inner
25m33s: workings of the thing that you&amp;#39;re using
25m35s: so do not rely on this because it may
25m37s: change in the future okay you can see
25m40s: the pams there look there are the prams
25m41s: that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re looking for and
25m43s: you know you might think oh yeah there
25m45s: it is I&amp;#39;m just going to go straight to
25m47s: recore Pam there oh yeah bang got it but
25m51s: no don&amp;#39;t do
25m54s: that because you
25m57s: may uh get tripped up in the next
26m0s: release of cap because they may have
26m2s: changed that internally that
26m4s: means don&amp;#39;t use it right does that make
26m7s: sense anyway okay so and we&amp;#39;ve got you
26m9s: know we&amp;#39;ve got the prams down here right
26m10s: perfect notice can anybody tell me this
26m13s: is this is a very obscure
26m16s: thing notice that we can see here in the
26m19s: the difference between this one here it
26m21s: says oh yeah it&amp;#39;s basically I mean this
26m22s: I guess this is this is sort of VSS code
26m24s: or a
26m25s: short um maybe it&amp;#39;s a node reppel thing
26m29s: you know a short way of describing it&amp;#39;s
26m33s: an array with one element in it and
26m34s: there it is right whereas this params
26m38s: here what&amp;#39;s the I mean click to expand
26m41s: oh there we go look at that I click to
26m43s: expand who knew okay um it says here
26m47s: it&amp;#39;s an array however did you also see
26m50s: it&amp;#39;s not really an array cuz ah ah that
26m54s: I think that that evaluated the params
26m57s: if we go back again
26m59s: let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s put that do that again
27m1s: interesting interesting add to
27m4s: watch re there&amp;#39;s pams our
27m8s: array but here
27m10s: pams that really should say
27m13s: evaluate click to evaluate because it
27m15s: sort of does something that&amp;#39;s a function
27m17s: look it&amp;#39;s a function and there it
27m19s: is right this uncore param equals this
27m22s: blah blah blah let&amp;#39;s move that look at
27m24s: that woohoo and what this really anyway
27m26s: yeah can anybody tell tell me why we can
27m30s: get the value we can evaluate params
27m33s: rec.
27m35s: params without because it&amp;#39;s a function
27m38s: look it&amp;#39;s a
27m39s: function but why we don&amp;#39;t have to do
27m41s: that and why actually doing that doesn&amp;#39;t
27m46s: work put in the chat what you think the
27m49s: reason for that might
27m52s: be and also remind me in a in a short
27m56s: while to come back to that if if people
27m59s: have answered or not answered if folks
28m1s: have answer right so why are we talking
28m4s: about this ah chakia is on it like a car
28m8s: onon it J exactly so params is a
28m13s: getter mdn getter Setter I think we
28m17s: talked about this before haven&amp;#39;t we get
28m18s: JavaScript a getter def defers the cost
28m21s: of calcula where is it is
28m24s: it a getter defers the cost of
28m27s: calculating the value until the value is
28m29s: needed okay if you if you never need it
28m31s: you never pay the cost basically you can
28m33s: have a there a simple
28m36s: example there you can have an object
28m39s: with a property you know there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s
28m40s: a property called log with an array as
28m43s: the value of that property you can also
28m46s: have something called
28m48s: latest which appears to the outside
28m51s: world as if it&amp;#39;s just a normal property
28m55s: so we can grab it like that
28m59s: but actually it&amp;#39;s a
29m1s: function okay and so when that
29m4s: latest property is requested when you
29m7s: know it&amp;#39;s the evaluation is
29m9s: requested then the function runs okay
29m13s: that&amp;#39;s a really cool way of being able
29m15s: to refer to other values in that in in
29m19s: the in that instance of that object okay
29m21s: I actually actually use that in one of
29m23s: the testers
29m24s: in um in our developer challenge in fact
29m27s: digress digress ooop digression alert
29m29s: anyway ah tester tester in in the tasks
29m34s: where was it in oh there we go in hello
29m36s: in fact last the Tuesday&amp;#39;s
29m41s: task I&amp;#39;m using a
29m46s: geta to grab stuff
29m49s: from here name cacro but actually in the
29m52s: init function I set the on anyway DJ
29m55s: stop digressing anyway so we now know
29m59s: rec. prams is an array and we want that
30m3s: one
30m4s: okay that&amp;#39;s why we have this thing here
30m7s: so let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s bring up let&amp;#39;s node if we
30m10s: say Rec equals and let&amp;#39;s just have
30m14s: fruit banana and then also we&amp;#39;ll have
30m17s: prams and it&amp;#39;s an array 1 two 3
30m23s: right if we know that we want that thing
30m27s: there
30m28s: the second item in an array in the array
30m32s: which is the value of the
30m34s: params of the incoming re we can
30m39s: say uh
30m41s: prams um Let&amp;#39;s ignore the first thing
30m45s: right oh tell you what let&amp;#39;s have the
30m47s: first one uh first second third right
30m50s: let&amp;#39;s do that equals
30m54s: W now first is one second second is two
30m59s: and third is
31m0s: three okay similarly and this is this is
31m4s: something that um if I wanted the second
31m8s: one i&amp;#39; probably do right so I&amp;#39;d say here
31m11s: um if I just wanted the second one not
31m13s: interested in anything else I could say
31m15s: here and we I think we talked about this
31m17s: before like underscore ah this is
31m19s: another another
31m21s: Convention of using an underscore in
31m23s: completely different context an
31m25s: underscore here means there is there is
31m28s: a value here but I don&amp;#39;t care what it is
31m30s: okay so I&amp;#39;m just going to assign it to
31m32s: you know a legitimate but stupid
31m36s: um variable name called
31m40s: underscore so now second is two notice
31m44s: here this is this is a node J I think
31m46s: they&amp;#39;ve seen this before this is a
31m48s: nodejs reppel thing because in the
31m51s: reppel normally if we say no JS and say
31m55s: a equals 1 and then I put underscore
31m58s: underscore is the I think again this is
32m1s: not specific to this digression over
32m4s: digression overr this is not specific to
32m6s: the no JS reppel this I think is quite
32m7s: common in reppel underscore is a
32m10s: convention again why is underscore so
32m13s: conventional is a convention again to to
32m16s: to return the evaluation the previous
32m19s: the the the latest the most recent the
32m22s: most recent value so if I say hello
32m29s: that&amp;#39;s the most recent value right the
32m30s: most recently valuated thing anyway how
32m34s: I confuse the heck out of everybody now
32m36s: um so ah yeah there you go so if we do
32m38s: this wre here uh Rec so if we wanted and
32m43s: this is like this is almost like an
32m44s: incoming um an incoming request so we
32m47s: could say
32m49s: prams ID right if and that will give us
32m53s: uh oh sorry equals W there that will
32m57s: give give
32m59s: us in ID that first thing there and that
33m4s: is the equivalent of what we&amp;#39;re doing
33m6s: here uh what here there prams ID the
33m9s: first one to get the first one in this
33m12s: thing
33m14s: here okay right so let&amp;#39;s get rid of that
33m19s: uh let&amp;#39;s kill that debug let&amp;#39;s get rid
33m22s: of that let&amp;#39;s go back here don&amp;#39;t need
33m24s: that go back smaller again uh slightly
33m26s: bigger there we go perfect
33m29s: so with that we know that we can get the
33m33s: guid to do a select right and what are
33m37s: we trying to do stock value right so in
33m39s: fact in fact in fact in fact yeah let&amp;#39;s
33m42s: open
33m42s: up on the terminal let&amp;#39;s get rid of that
33m46s: break point as well uh let&amp;#39;s go there
33m48s: and say CDs
33m50s: reppel let&amp;#39;s make
33m52s: that a little bit uh smaller there and
33m56s: um say
33m58s: CDs test
34m0s: oops which will actually I should have
34m2s: awaited that um which will start the
34m5s: server up it&amp;#39;ll run on random Port as
34m7s: we&amp;#39;ve seen already let&amp;#39;s get rid not
34m9s: confused us let&amp;#39;s get rid of that for
34m10s: now and now we can say
34m13s: select yeah in fact um const books
34m17s: remember this books equals cds.
34m20s: entities
34m22s: books and if we look at books we can see
34m25s: that there&amp;#39;s a definition remember that
34m26s: this is the definition from the schema
34m28s: level not from the service level because
34m30s: if the service level
34m32s: definition uh CDs entities and then give
34m36s: it the name space as it were Bookshop we
34m39s: get something slightly different I think
34m41s: books we should be able to tell the
34m42s: difference if this there we go yeah in
34m45s: fact let me just make it a bit smaller
34m47s: just for a second you can see there&amp;#39;s a
34m49s: difference between the schema level
34m53s: definition of the books entity and the
34m55s: service level ENT as in there level uh
35m0s: books definition entity we can see it&amp;#39;s
35m2s: a projection that&amp;#39;s the projection from
35m4s: the service definition entity books as
35m6s: projection on right
35m9s: Etc okay oh oh how lovely is that we
35m13s: also see not only it at the service
35m17s: level of the books entity definition we
35m19s: not only see that it&amp;#39;s a projection but
35m21s: we also see the action the bound
35m23s: function sorry the bound function there
35m25s: it is amazing
35m27s: never noticed that before it&amp;#39;s quite
35m28s: cool okay so
35m31s: now we can now say select from books
35m37s: okay oh yeah we need to await that of
35m38s: course
35m39s: await but now we know we can grab the
35m42s: guid good day Andrew and how are you
35m45s: welcome Andrew in fact I was just
35m47s: talking about you um I thought we might
35m49s: what time is it now 8:35 8:35 oh my God
35m52s: have a quick look at the request test
35m54s: that you were asking about um so yes
35m56s: we&amp;#39;ll do that later on remind me in
35m58s: about 10 minutes Andrew remind me in 10
36m0s: minutes to look at the request test or
36m3s: something uh so if we now uh say select
36m9s: uh from books where and now this thing
36m12s: here don&amp;#39;t need that uh where yeah we
36m15s: can see wa look at that look we can do
36m17s: that there&amp;#39;s all sorts of different
36m21s: ways
36m24s: of expressing a wear clause look at that
36m28s: we could even say all right let&amp;#39;s do
36m29s: this let&amp;#39;s do it let&amp;#39;s do one of these
36m31s: let&amp;#39;s do this one as a string
36m35s: right uh
36m37s: where um and what&amp;#39;s the what&amp;#39;s the
36m43s: um uh no not there uh books Let&amp;#39;s go to
36m48s: schema it&amp;#39;s of course it&amp;#39;s yeah it&amp;#39;s ID
36m51s: but I could even I could have even
36m52s: looked at the DJ come on get with it I
36m54s: could have looked at the yaml definition
36m56s: but look look we can see that the books
36m59s: has an aspect CU ID CU ID the aspect is
37m3s: key ID so it&amp;#39;s ID I&amp;#39;m looking for right
37m5s: so I could say
37m7s: now let&amp;#39;s put that back up there where
37m9s: ID
37m11s: equals right in fact let&amp;#39;s put that in a
37m13s: double quotes ID equals and then what&amp;#39;s
37m16s: the where&amp;#39;s the um there okay ID equals
37m21s: that I mean that&amp;#39;s sort of you know
37m23s: amazing in
37m25s: its basicness is that the right even
37m27s: phrase there we can get that but what we
37m31s: can also do is say and this is this is
37m34s: something maybe this is slightly nicer
37m36s: ID
37m38s: equals uh well we don&amp;#39;t have an ID so
37m40s: let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s put that in there ID equals
37m42s: that because we&amp;#39;re going to have that in
37m44s: our function aren&amp;#39;t we once once we
37m46s: actually start writing it so we can now
37m48s: say what id
37m50s: equals in um in these um in this string
37m54s: expression thing I can&amp;#39;t remember what
37m55s: the technical term for that is uh I ID
37m58s: equals ID that seems a little bit neater
38m2s: where ID equals
38m5s: what uh ID mismatch have I done that
38m9s: wrong what&amp;#39;s going on providing don&amp;#39;t
38m11s: need that anymore uh ID equals ah no
38m14s: that&amp;#39;s all right ID
38m16s: equals what have I not done uh back tag
38m21s: back tick back oh Maas is on it what
38m24s: have I not done there uh backed I&amp;#39;ve got
38m27s: the practics I thought I the where ID
38m30s: equals let&amp;#39;s just put that in there for
38m32s: a second like that okay and now have I
38m35s: got id id yeah it&amp;#39;s there so let&amp;#39;s try
38m38s: that again what did I do before uh ID
38m43s: equals
38m46s: ID that&amp;#39;s
38m51s: interesting Echo no not Echo what&amp;#39;s it
38m53s: called
38m55s: console.log ID equals
38m58s: ID let&amp;#39;s
38m59s: just ah ah of course of
39m4s: course um of course that&amp;#39;s interesting
39m8s: what I&amp;#39;m missing is of course because
39m11s: we&amp;#39;re still constructing a query string
39m15s: so what I need there is to put the
39m18s: evaluation of the ID variable through
39m21s: through this expression thing here in
39m23s: the quotes there we go did that was that
39m26s: in the example
39m28s: oh oh you know what you know what I
39m31s: think there&amp;#39;s a bug in the
39m32s: documentation maybe or maybe it&amp;#39;s just
39m35s: me let&amp;#39;s just try that ID let&amp;#39;s just
39m37s: paste that
39m38s: in there let&amp;#39;s do that let&amp;#39;s do that A8
39m42s: select. from
39m44s: books where I I&amp;#39;m going to do this
39m47s: because I just love doing it because
39m48s: it&amp;#39;s just so so crazy good right with
39m50s: spaces where um let&amp;#39;s put that in in the
39m55s: back tick there right
39m59s: uh and of course that&amp;#39;s not going to
40m0s: work because we don&amp;#39;t have W data ID so
40m1s: we say um wre equals
40m6s: data
40m9s: uh
40m11s: ID uh my goodness me this is digressing
40m14s: so crazily but it&amp;#39;s all right I think
40m16s: we&amp;#39;re learning we&amp;#39;re all learning
40m17s: together here aren&amp;#39;t we uh there um
40m21s: that&amp;#39;s see so rec. dat do ah damn uh ID
40m26s: we got that so we can do that now now
40m27s: can&amp;#39;t we but is this going to work is
40m30s: this going to work
40m34s: uh so I will um I will I&amp;#39;ll send a
40m39s: modification to that in fact yes I&amp;#39;ll
40m40s: send a modification to that now well not
40m42s: now but after the live stream so that
40m44s: should have single quotes or some quotes
40m47s: around that thing shouldn&amp;#39;t
40m50s: it
40m51s: amazing so oh hello Nim how do you use
40m54s: an external terminal not the one in vs
40m56s: code I&amp;#39;m using Windows but haven&amp;#39;t been
40m57s: able to do that when you say an external
40m59s: terminal external to what Nim let me
41m1s: know what you mean I mean in vs code of
41m3s: course you get uh the ability to sort of
41m6s: open a local you know what I&amp;#39;m doing
41m8s: here you know a terminal local to the to
41m11s: the machine now I can&amp;#39;t comment on your
41m13s: situation because I don&amp;#39;t use I don&amp;#39;t
41m14s: work on Windows um but I&amp;#39;m pretty sure
41m18s: vs code will offer different uh terminal
41m23s: uh contexts for example the command
41m25s: prompt or Powershell if you&amp;#39;re that way
41m28s: inclined and it depending on whether
41m29s: you&amp;#39;re running with sigwin there or
41m32s: maybe Windows uh subsystem for Linux WL
41m36s: uh you get different types of terminals
41m38s: available to according to the Linux
41m40s: subsystem that you&amp;#39;re using there I
41m42s: don&amp;#39;t know um but basically I&amp;#39;m on oh ah
41m46s: so I&amp;#39;ve just seen um I&amp;#39;ve Just Seen
41m48s: matias&amp;#39;s comment here uh use Dev
41m51s: container so um so yes sorry thank you m
41m55s: thank you Matias for keeping me on those
41m57s: on the straight and narrow what I&amp;#39;m
41m59s: doing here in vs code that&amp;#39;s running on
42m2s: my machine here which is Mac OS you can
42m4s: see there the little apple thing um but
42m7s: I&amp;#39;m using cat uh in fact let me just
42m10s: open up another terminal I&amp;#39;m using
42m14s: uh a Linux terminal right because Linux
42m17s: is you know the one true operating
42m19s: system obviously uh for PCs and um
42m22s: anyway but I&amp;#39;m using a Dev container so
42m25s: if you watch episode one of this series
42m27s: series you&amp;#39;ll find out how to set up the
42m28s: dev container in fact uh cap B2B I&amp;#39;ll
42m31s: put this in the uh put there because
42m34s: we&amp;#39;re going to be referring to it I&amp;#39;ve
42m35s: refer to it now how do I do this edit I
42m37s: hate that pop uh there we go and there
42m43s: uh first episode with Dev container
42m49s: details um oh sorry no sorry not
42m53s: um uh series GitHub
42m58s: there there we go there Nim um you can
43m3s: check you can check out that and that
43m4s: will give you a proper shell you can do
43m7s: you can use a bass shell right the one
43m9s: true shell uh so I hope that helps um
43m12s: additionally in part 11 you used yq and
43m14s: I haven&amp;#39;t been able to use that either
43m16s: well you need to install it you know um
43m18s: I think I&amp;#39;m not sure have I got yq
43m20s: installed here or not no I haven&amp;#39;t got
43m22s: yet yq installed but I&amp;#39;ve used yq before
43m25s: um let&amp;#39;s just open up another terminal I
43m27s: use your yq a lot there&amp;#39;s yq so you just
43m30s: install it you know to you for your
43m32s: operating system Dev containers put it
43m34s: in a de container that&amp;#39;s the best thing
43m37s: uh so chakia says single quote I mikolai
43m40s: good morning mikolai I think it might
43m41s: work without function brackets ah yes
43m43s: sorry thank you for bringing you back on
43m45s: back on track Nikolai uh mikolai sorry
43m48s: um uh so that&amp;#39;s that that&amp;#39;s that um
43m52s: there&amp;#39;s a different way of I like this
43m54s: right I like this query by expression I
43m56s: think that by example sorry I think
43m58s: that&amp;#39;s what that means qu bar example
43m59s: yeah I guess so uh and text to speech or
44m3s: I don&amp;#39;t even oh tag template string not
44m5s: text to speech tag template string there
44m8s: uh so uh we can also do this which is a
44m10s: lot nicer I think so this is what I
44m13s: trying to get to so we can now say here
44m15s: I don&amp;#39;t like what vsq does that we can
44m16s: also say here um we can have
44m20s: ID as a sort of an object ID and then
44m22s: rec. dat.
44m24s: ID that works as well okay okay oh my
44m28s: God uh in the docu there are no
44m31s: brackets uh brackets where HP good
44m34s: morning to you HP uh no brackets where
44m37s: exactly in the dock put it in the put
44m39s: where you mean in the dock thank you HP
44m41s: fantastic um and welcome welcome
44m44s: welcome uh so let&amp;#39;s do that right but
44m49s: then what we want to do getting back to
44m52s: remembering what we&amp;#39;re trying to do
44m53s: which is stock value we&amp;#39;re saying stock
44m55s: value is basically stock times price so
44m57s: why don&amp;#39;t we add a clause here um
45m3s: columns I can never remember um let&amp;#39;s do
45m7s: this right I wonder if we can do this
45m9s: await and then
45m12s: dot no we can&amp;#39;t select ah wait a come on
45m16s: DJ did
45m20s: before object. Keys select we can see we
45m23s: can do
45m24s: that do from
45m28s: uh dot where uh from
45m32s: where oh no local anyway yeah
45m36s: anyway select
45m38s: where from books s columns yeah
45m43s: columns stock price and I think we can
45m47s: also put those in you know as in an
45m48s: array I think uh I think we have to put
45m50s: them in a rate do we stock
45m54s: price uh
45m57s: what we doing TJ come on come on I&amp;#39;m
45m59s: just making things up I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m
46m1s: no idea what I&amp;#39;m doing there we go stock
46m4s: price
46m5s: okay but what we can also
46m9s: do uh HP in the docu there on oh sorry
46m12s: I&amp;#39;ve read that already in the do there
46m13s: no brackets sorry
46m15s: um we can also say I&amp;#39;m sure we could
46m19s: should put in the string as well we did
46m21s: that before
46m23s: stock
46m24s: price oh sorry right
46m29s: uh this much expecting from
46m33s: books I thought we could do it in uh
46m36s: let&amp;#39;s go back to the column this thing
46m38s: this thing for now stock price and then
46m41s: how about stock times
46m47s: price oh of course yeah I have to have
46m49s: an alias as stock
46m53s: value check it out uh I believe HP is
46m57s: referring to no brackets after where in
47m0s: the TTS example soan thank you for after
47m3s: where in the TTS where ah yes it&amp;#39;s got
47m6s: no brackets ah interesting oh yeah we we
47m9s: should try that well done HP HP is he
47m11s: got super sharp eyes you picked up
47m14s: something last week as well it&amp;#39;s
47m15s: brilliant so let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s just try
47m17s: that select where which one was it in
47m21s: the uh in the tech let&amp;#39;s call it text to
47m23s: speech from now on uh ID equals that uh
47m29s: [Music]
47m30s: there there there let&amp;#39;s try
47m34s: that
47m37s: that&amp;#39;s ah of course that is the string
47m42s: how weird so that
47m46s: works but that
47m50s: doesn&amp;#39;t that is super
47m54s: interesting why does can anybody tell me
47m57s: why that that
48m0s: works what&amp;#39;s going on there why that
48m7s: works but why when you put it in
48m9s: Brackets it doesn&amp;#39;t
48m11s: work that&amp;#39;s interesting I&amp;#39;ll dig into
48m14s: that and find out because my brain is
48m16s: not working at the moment anyway let&amp;#39;s
48m19s: try and get to the end of this thing
48m20s: here why are we trying to do oh stop yes
48m21s: there we go so if we now let&amp;#39;s just get
48m24s: on back on the straight and narrow let&amp;#39;s
48m26s: go back here and
48m28s: say um oh wait
48m32s: select
48m35s: columns uh well we&amp;#39;ll just do one shall
48m38s: we
48m40s: columns um
48m43s: stock times
48m46s: price as
48m49s: stock I use the same sort of camel case
48m52s: type thing there um
48m58s: from uh from books because we&amp;#39;ve got
49m3s: books defined up here haven&amp;#39;t we there
49m4s: books there from
49m6s: books where and we&amp;#39;ll use that thing
49m9s: there
49m10s: ID uh what was the thing ID equals there
49m14s: we go yeah ID
49m23s: equals oh sorry yes where ID equals
49m28s: uh and now what do we want to put in
49m29s: there right what do we want to put in
49m31s: there uh we want to add this thing here
49m34s: prams
49m36s: ID okay because don&amp;#39;t forget the request
49m40s: is captured and destructured by this
49m43s: expression now we understand hopefully
49m44s: we understand what what&amp;#39;s going on there
49m46s: prams id
49m48s: id id and then why is it squiggly
49m52s: underline because I think it&amp;#39;s going to
49m53s: tell us about the uh unexpected token
49m57s: uh oh I know I think um async there we
50m1s: go it needs to be an async after a wait
50m3s: if we&amp;#39;re going to use a weight it needs
50m4s: to be an async function where ID where
50m8s: we don&amp;#39;t need that square bracket there
50m12s: from wa select columns from from books
50m14s: where ID there we go um we don&amp;#39;t need
50m18s: that either perfect and then we&amp;#39;ll say
50m21s: here um well let
50m23s: actually yeah return let&amp;#39;s just go for
50m25s: it return
50m27s: in fact wait result equals wait sorry
50m32s: result const result
50m36s: equals
50m38s: that uh let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s log it first loger
50m41s: result and just return 42 for now right
50m44s: let&amp;#39;s do
50m45s: that see what
50m49s: happens okay CDs watch and open up here
50m53s: and we&amp;#39;ll do have I got that there there
50m55s: we go try that
51m1s: okay we get the 42 right and in a log of
51m5s: result we get what do we get do we get
51m8s: anything at all uh log result results
51m11s: columns I can&amp;#39;t see any result get uh
51m14s: logger results we got logger going there
51m17s: what&amp;#39;s going on logger total stock total
51m19s: stock why is that total stock like that
51m22s: oh anyway
51m23s: um
51m25s: logger let&amp;#39;s just see we get we get that
51m29s: oh there we go it&amp;#39;s working ah I hav I
51m32s: haven&amp;#39;t saved it okay fine save that
51m34s: okay fine fine fine stock value so we
51m37s: can actually say
51m39s: return
51m40s: um sorry return
51m43s: result. stock
51m52s: value what what what return result.
51m56s: stock value you is that right oh no ah
51m59s: what&amp;#39;s the thing I&amp;#39;ve missed look check
52m1s: it out brackets are our
52m4s: friend we don&amp;#39;t get an object back from
52m8s: this select we get an array so we want
52m12s: re I we can do one of many things right
52m14s: we can either say here result stock
52m18s: value 150 or of course we can just say I
52m22s: think we did this the other day
52m24s: one and then of course it&amp;#39;s not already
52m26s: so we&amp;#39;re going to have an error there
52m29s: there save that we want one we want one
52m32s: we want one uh
52m34s: result
52m36s: um stock
52m38s: value what&amp;#39;s going on now come on DJ uh
52m42s: un cannot read properties of undefined
52m43s: from what one oh
52m48s: ah see I broken my rule of new lines
52m53s: this should be on a new line as well so
52m54s: I can see where the first one is there
52m56s: we go that&amp;#39;s
52m59s: better 150 there we go okay Andrew
53m4s: Andrew hello we want one but also you
53m5s: didn&amp;#39;t I just remembered you didn&amp;#39;t
53m7s: remind me about the request test so why
53m8s: don&amp;#39;t we just it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just less than
53m11s: seven minutes to
53m13s: go we&amp;#39;ve got the stock value we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve
53m15s: implemented that um I think I egged it
53m18s: on the um on the digressions and the
53m20s: random things there but weld on HP for
53m22s: pointing out that that works because
53m23s: it&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s no brackets I don&amp;#39;t know
53m25s: why it works because there no brackets
53m27s: we&amp;#39;ll find out I was in a flow oh well I
53m30s: was in a I was in something um right so
53m35s: let&amp;#39;s just draw a line under that oh
53m37s: look at that half eaten
53m38s: mini what&amp;#39;s it called cinnamon thing
53m42s: squashed as
53m45s: well so last
53m48s: [Music]
53m51s: bit our tasks get rid of that get rid of
53m54s: that get rid of that there we go so
54m1s: um what we&amp;#39;ve got what I use for
54m5s: testing in the context
54m8s: of
54m10s: the developer
54m12s: challenge is this thing
54m15s: called where is it let me go back to the
54m18s: sample I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m sort of running along
54m20s: I&amp;#39;ve got a candidate here which is all
54m22s: of the answers obviously ah sugar that
54m25s: explains it it does sugar and
54m29s: caffeine um but I&amp;#39;ve also got this
54m32s: sample which is basically keeping up
54m34s: with where you are on the tasks so at
54m37s: the moment I&amp;#39;ve implemented these two
54m39s: things right ping hello and Su a and
54m42s: some and there&amp;#39;s the implementation
54m44s: quite simple right now in here I&amp;#39;ve got
54m48s: this testing remote I&amp;#39;ve also got a
54m50s: local testing thing let me show you the
54m51s: local testing thing for a second um the
54m54s: local testing in the candida area is
54m56s: where I use bats the sort of the bash
54m59s: automated testing and I just use Curl
55m2s: commands to do all the things so I can
55m5s: um I can do that I can actually start
55m7s: the start this
55m9s: server oh that&amp;#39;s no let not even go
55m12s: there let&amp;#39;s get rid of that get rid of
55m14s: that and say here uh where are we sample
55m17s: sample sample testing
55m20s: remote I&amp;#39;ve got my request test so I can
55m23s: set I can start the I can start a local
55m27s: tester but we&amp;#39;ll also use the main we&amp;#39;ll
55m29s: use the main tester right declare tester
55m32s: service base tester service base
55m34s: defaults
55m37s: to here okay and then it&amp;#39;s going to
55m40s: assume a local service running on 800 my
55m44s: service okay so let&amp;#39;s do that first of
55m47s: all so I&amp;#39;ll say here in my sample um
55m51s: Port equals
55m52s: 8,000 CDs watch okay
55m57s: and then put my head down the bottom
55m59s: there um in fact let me just swap those
56m1s: over there we go that&amp;#39;s better don&amp;#39;t see
56m3s: to see that
56m5s: um so now I can
56m8s: say uh remote uh testing remote request
56m13s: test and it give me example so I can say
56m15s: here Q
56m16s: macro my community ID and then the the
56m20s: the path of the service end point so
56m24s: it&amp;#39;s you know the base the default path
56m26s: is
56m27s: is Local Host 8000 right and then the
56m32s: tester service okay so what&amp;#39;s going to
56m34s: happen when I when I default the tester
56m35s: service to where it is it&amp;#39;s not going to
56m38s: be able to reach this Local H but it
56m39s: doesn&amp;#39;t matter a basic ping we&amp;#39;re going
56m42s: to get error calling service endpoint
56m45s: because of
