8m58s: still from uh from from having them up
9m0s: at Christmas but I put them across there
9m1s: I was inspired by another live streamer
9m4s: that I watch a lot which is Brett Fisher
9m7s: uh in fact if I go to here Brett Fisher
9m10s: there we go Docker and devops let me
9m13s: share that as well he&amp;#39;s back he&amp;#39;s back
9m16s: uh I I really love this uh this channel
9m19s: Brett&amp;#39;s got a lot of stuff on Docker
9m21s: devops cubetti swarm
9m24s: everything hi Antonio there there we go
9m27s: nice little Segway to CPU memory
9m28s: Graphics yes yes good morning Antonio to
9m31s: bomia in uh Portugal there we go uh so
9m35s: yeah so we got
9m36s: Antonio also live streaming next week on
9m39s: what day is it it&amp;#39;s on uh wed Tuesday or
9m42s: Wednesday it&amp;#39;s midweek isn&amp;#39;t it um so
9m45s: there we go so let&amp;#39;s have a look live in
9m47s: five days I think it&amp;#39;s Tuesday isn&amp;#39;t it
9m48s: Antonio let us know Antonio when it is I
9m50s: can&amp;#39;t work out which day in my head
9m52s: right now so we got a lot of things
9m55s: going coming so with the new design as
9m58s: well Antonio&amp;#39;s done a live stream
9m59s: already that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s number
10m0s: two but that&amp;#39;s why ours for example
10m3s: number one this is the first
10m5s: episode of a new series Hussein good
10m10s: good night to you in Istanbul welcome
10m13s: welcome welcome himansu hello as
10m15s: well uh so this is the first number one
10m19s: episode of a new series where we&amp;#39;re
10m22s: going back to basics so I
10m25s: think I&amp;#39;ve had we&amp;#39;ve all the Advocates
10m29s: have had feedback um from doing code
10m34s: jams from tutorial participants from Dev
10m38s: toober Fest at the live stream&amp;#39;s on
10m40s: Wednesday thanks Antonio the Antonio&amp;#39;s
10m42s: live stream is on Wednesday make sure
10m44s: you go over here and subscribe to the
10m47s: channel I&amp;#39;m on this is my know this is
10m48s: the sap developers ID now but subscribe
10m51s: to the channel and then hit
10m52s: notifications and everything so you get
10m54s: the notifications fcan good morning to
10m56s: you as well and welcome so um
11m0s: I&amp;#39;ve lost what I was gon to say now uh
11m1s: oh yeah
11m2s: so a lot of folks have asked for a sort
11m8s: of a Back to Basics and more
11m10s: fundamentals on cap okay we have done on
11m15s: hands on SCB
11m16s: Dev a number of sort of miniseries on
11m19s: various aspects of cap sort of quite
11m21s: Niche things like man in fact you can if
11m23s: you want to look at those we have the
11m24s: playlists here where are the playlists
11m26s: here for example I&amp;#39;m hoping I can find
11m28s: them straight away yeah so we did a we
11m30s: did a live stream series on managed
11m33s: associations um and we also did a live
11m37s: stream series on service integration so
11m40s: those are quite sort of focused but
11m42s: really what we&amp;#39;re going to be doing in
11m44s: this new series is just going back to
11m46s: basics and starting from absolute
11m48s: scratch um and dispelling any fears or
11m52s: questions you may have so that&amp;#39;s the
11m53s: other thing during this episode and all
11m56s: future episodes and I&amp;#39;m sure Antonio
11m59s: would say the same thing as well with
12m0s: his live streams and all my other
12m1s: developer Advocate colleagues who may or
12m3s: may not be doing live streams in the
12m4s: future in
12m6s: 2024 the whole point for you and for me
12m10s: is that you can ask questions we can
12m11s: interact in the chat because I&amp;#39;m
12m12s: monitoring the chat down here you saw
12m14s: that little Chromebook uh thing on my
12m17s: desk I&amp;#39;ve got the chat there now so I
12m19s: can see people saying hello and
12m21s: everything so there&amp;#39;s no question too
12m24s: silly to ask okay I might not be able to
12m26s: answer it but we can work it out
12m28s: together I it hello Amit and
12m31s: welcome so um it&amp;#39;s all about cap sap
12m36s: cloudification programming model and
12m37s: what I thought we could do just today
12m40s: this first episode is start really
12m43s: really
12m46s: simple and I wanted
12m49s: to start with a setup it&amp;#39;s very warm
12m52s: actually I put the fire on but it&amp;#39;s
12m53s: quite warm now in fact open the window
12m55s: maybe not um that door there there we go
12m58s: that&amp;#39;s better
12m59s: um so that&amp;#39;s the door to the bathroom by
13m1s: the way so if you look in fact if you
13m3s: look at the this is this is just
13m4s: completely going off piece if you go to
13m6s: my blog and look at this for this latest
13m9s: blog post that&amp;#39;s where I am so right now
13m12s: open imion new tab that&amp;#39;s where I am
13m14s: there&amp;#39;s my desk and there&amp;#39;s a monitor
13m16s: there and I&amp;#39;ve just opened that door to
13m18s: the bathroom there we go anyway anyway
13m20s: that&amp;#39;s just too much information
13m23s: um if we can do this so that everybody
13m29s: can follow along either live while we do
13m31s: it and some of those folks who are crazy
13m35s: or silly or brave enough to do that
13m37s: would be amazing let me know but I want
13m40s: to do this uh in a way that everybody
13m43s: can play along
13m46s: now the web page we&amp;#39;ve got up here
13m50s: welcome to cap the cloud application
13m51s: programming model this is known
13m54s: colloquially internally as well I think
13m57s: some people pronounce it Kayo I
13m59s: pronounce it capaya which is sort of not
14m2s: really authentic the idea is that it&amp;#39;s
14m6s: uh play on the Italian word cap who is
14m9s: any anybody from Italy here who can uh
14m11s: who can correct my pronunciation but
14m14s: capir is obviously to understand to to
14m17s: Gro okay and the whole point of capire
14m20s: is that it&amp;#39;s documentation that helps
14m21s: you understand cap right
14m25s: so and it&amp;#39;s a wonderful resource so
14m28s: we&amp;#39;re going to be going through over the
14m30s: next few
14m32s: episodes the getting started okay partly
14m37s: because you know I can&amp;#39;t think of
14m39s: anything better because this is great
14m42s: partly because I think these days I
14m46s: think we sort of need certainly me I
14m48s: speaking for myself but let me know in
14m50s: the chat we
14m52s: need sometimes a reason to go and stare
14m56s: at the documentation and work through it
14m59s: so we&amp;#39;re going going to be working
15m0s: through this documentation together
15m1s: because it&amp;#39;s
15m3s: awesome the other thing though is that
15m7s: hey poke poke geek or is it Pokey geek
15m9s: is it as in Pokemon or poke as in Peak
15m11s: and poke from the home computers of the
15m13s: 1980s let me know uh but hello
15m16s: anyway um so the the point is that we&amp;#39;ve
15m20s: got this getting started section and
15m23s: we&amp;#39;ve jumped here getting started in a
15m25s: nutshell from the big get started button
15m28s: here however however however
15m31s: however okay all this getting started
15m35s: here
15m36s: assumes that you&amp;#39;ve got the appropriate
15m41s: tools and libraries and everything set
15m44s: up RTM Antonio Antonio says RTM I think
15m48s: You&amp;#39; missed out a letter there Antonio I
15m49s: think that letter might be F and I think
15m51s: we&amp;#39;re allowed to say rtfm maybe not
15m53s: spell it out loud but yeah
15m56s: rtfm you know what I capir so Lu L is
16m1s: saying capir excellent um yeah so the
16m6s: jump start guide which is this jump
16m7s: start development the one before this is
16m11s: like the description of what anybody
16m15s: needs to do to set up for local
16m16s: development and I&amp;#39;ll say up front as
16m17s: well I said this in the uh we wrote this
16m19s: in the description of this live stream
16m22s: episode that we&amp;#39;re going to be focusing
16m25s: on node.js there has been a question
16m26s: about Java I&amp;#39;m not a Java person uh
16m29s: maybe we can get somebody on to to S
16m31s: cover some of the Java aspects because
16m33s: it&amp;#39;s also awesome it&amp;#39;s Pokemon itself
16m35s: poke geek excellent um there&amp;#39;s probably
16m38s: only a few of us around here that old
16m39s: enough to remember Peak and poke those
16m41s: commands on the 8bit computers of the
16m43s: 1980s where you could read and write
16m45s: memory locations
16m47s: directly
16m49s: anyway um so we&amp;#39;re going to be doing no.
16m52s: JS now if you have a look at uh the
16m56s: table of contents here if you want to
16m58s: set up for local
17m0s: development right which is what we&amp;#39;re
17m1s: going to do because one of the beauties
17m5s: of cap is that you can develop it in the
17m7s: cloud for example using Sab business
17m9s: application Studio or Dev space there or
17m11s: a code space on GitHub or whatever right
17m16s: um but quite often and and embracing the
17m22s: beauty of this sort
17m24s: of fast Dev turnaround you want to be be
17m27s: able to develop locally on your own
17m29s: machine however I was thinking
17m33s: hm if you want to install for local
17m36s: devel set up for local development any
17m38s: of you out there including me on your
17m41s: machine whether it&amp;#39;s a Windows a Linux a
17m43s: Mac device you know whatever Chromebook
17m46s: Chrome OS all these different things you
17m48s: need to install node.js you need to
17m51s: install the CDs DK we&amp;#39;ll talk about what
17m54s: that is shortly you need to install
17m57s: git
17m59s: SQL light if you&amp;#39;re doing Java cap you
18m2s: need to install Java Maven and you need
18m4s: to install Visual Studio code vs code I
18m7s: mean you can use any editor you
18m9s: want vs code is what uh
18m14s: cap um promotes because a it&amp;#39;s pretty a
18m18s: pretty awesome
18m19s: editor and it&amp;#39;s available for all
18m22s: platforms and also of course the sap
18m25s: business application Studio Dev spaces
18m27s: are also based B on the
18m29s: open-source components of vs code code
18m32s: OSS I think it&amp;#39;s called okay so I think
18m35s: when when was it Antonio I can&amp;#39;t
18m36s: remember maybe two or three four months
18m39s: ago they switched from Eclipse Thea as a
18m42s: basis for the depth spaces in the
18m43s: business publication Studio to code OSS
18m46s: and it&amp;#39;s awesome and it allows for a
18m48s: little bit of a better sharing of
18m52s: extensions between actual vs code and
18m56s: Dev spaces in the business application
18m58s: Studio and also of
18m59s: course GitHub code spaces are basically
19m3s: also the same as Dev spaces in the
19m6s: business application Studio or vice
19m8s: versa so it makes sense to have a vs
19m11s: code based set however however however
19m13s: you know having spoke to many of you
19m17s: during code jamps a lot of you have you
19m21s: know laptop configurations that
19m23s: maybe prevent you from installing these
19m26s: sort of things and you don&amp;#39;t want to or
19m28s: you not allowed to install
19m31s: things so what I&amp;#39;ve decided and also
19m34s: because I&amp;#39;m you know I&amp;#39;m obsessed with
19m37s: everything in
19m40s: containers what I want to do is go on
19m43s: this little journey with you with the
19m45s: minimum footprint possible on your
19m48s: actual laptop so that you can do all
19m50s: sorts of things without messing up your
19m52s: laptop installing you things having to
19m54s: maybe have admin rights and so on and so
19m57s: forth
20m0s: so all I&amp;#39;m going to require you to to
20m3s: install if you want to follow along is
20m7s: vs code and also a container engine now
20m12s: this is not a
20m13s: container Series so we&amp;#39;re not going to
20m15s: get into the vagaries of you know Docker
20m18s: desktop versus podman desktop versus lxc
20m22s: all these different container
20m24s: Technologies for the purposes of
20m27s: learning
20m29s: I use Docker desktop okay and for anyone
20m33s: learning personally you know this is
20m36s: free so it&amp;#39;s great now if you&amp;#39;re using
20m38s: it for your corporate work for your for
20m40s: the you know for your client sorry for
20m43s: your client for your employer there may
20m45s: be a contract in place with Docker to
20m47s: use Docker desktop with a license
20m49s: version brought from a personal learning
20m51s: perspective you know that&amp;#39;s what I
20m54s: use and it&amp;#39;s awesome I mean again like I
20m56s: say you can install pod man deskt and
20m58s: use the same sort of thing but I&amp;#39;m going
20m59s: to be using Docker desktop so all you
21m1s: need is Docker desktop vs code and
21m5s: that&amp;#39;s it okay so with that in
21m9s: mind let me show you what I&amp;#39;ve set up
21m13s: for us so that we can start on this
21m15s: journey helmet containers thumbs up
21m17s: excellent Nico good morning Nico Nico
21m20s: how come you haven&amp;#39;t got a um a spanner
21m23s: next to your name uh you should we&amp;#39;ll
21m25s: talk about that later you should have
21m26s: admin access as your own personal IDE
21m28s: anyway fan yes oh oh does anyone have
21m30s: experience in build oh sorry I missed
21m32s: that question does anyone have
21m33s: experience in building a cap software as
21m34s: a service without any DB just
21m36s: projections on public apis yes and Nico
21m40s: answers it&amp;#39;s literally as simple as not
21m42s: using a DB yes I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a
21m44s: beautifully uh flippant but well well
21m46s: meaning uh reply but basically that&amp;#39;s
21m49s: exactly what it is what Nico says so
21m51s: effectively you know to to to run a cap
21m55s: service you can either have you know
21m57s: persist layer and that persistence layer
21m59s: can be you know anything like you know
22m1s: SQL light but there are you know there
22m4s: are sort of things to think about when
22m6s: you&amp;#39;re using SQL light which is
22m8s: a a file based uh SQL storage system to
22m14s: something like postest or something like
22m15s: sap Hannah sap Hannah cloud and so on
22m19s: you can also run a an inprocess in
22m21s: memory SQL light database for sort of
22m24s: you know ephemeral data if you&amp;#39;re just
22m26s: doing sort of calculation SE and so on
22m29s: or you don&amp;#39;t need any database at all
22m31s: and the other thing is that you can
22m34s: build a cap service that is effectively
22m37s: a proxy so you integrate other services
22m41s: we we do we&amp;#39;ve got a Cod jam on this
22m42s: we&amp;#39;ve got a service integration with cap
22m45s: that is all about bringing in the
22m47s: definition of an API a public API in
22m50s: this case an S4 hanter
22m52s: API and then sort of wrapping that with
22m56s: some uh new entity definitions some
22m59s: schema definitions to sort of minimize
23m2s: the the exposure that we want to control
23m6s: of that public API in a new API sort of
23m9s: putting a you know a veneer on it okay
23m11s: there&amp;#39;s no database involved there right
23m13s: so yeah absolutely uh super
23m16s: straightforward with cap you&amp;#39;ll find
23m17s: that one of the one of the beauties of
23m19s: of cap is that what&amp;#39;s that phrase it
23m23s: makes simple things easy things simple
23m26s: and hard things possible something like
23m32s: that pearl easy simple hard
23m37s: possible is from oh yeah making the easy
23m39s: things easy and the hard things possible
23m41s: there we go inspired by uh the creator
23m43s: of one of the most beautiful programming
23m45s: languages in the world pearl of course
23m46s: and that&amp;#39;s what that&amp;#39;s what cap is for
23m48s: me as well okay um so here we go also
23m53s: there&amp;#39;s brilliant discussion between
23m54s: Nico and fulan I&amp;#39;ll let that continue
23m56s: because what I want to show you is in uh
23m59s: oh by the way by the way the sap devs
24m1s: the latest developer news is out let me
24m3s: share that oh yes let me share that URL
24m6s: there across
24m8s: here Bang there there&amp;#39;s the latest sap
24m11s: developer news now let me go across to
24m14s: this ridiculously small deliberately
24m17s: small
24m18s: starter okay it&amp;#39;s got read me which is
24m21s: literally just that title so that&amp;#39;s
24m23s: useless and then it&amp;#39;s got this directory
24m27s: called
24m28s: Dev container which is like a well-known
24m30s: name and vs code will recognize that
24m32s: when it starts up and says oh there&amp;#39;s
24m33s: something in here that&amp;#39;s important in
24m35s: terms of running within a container okay
24m38s: so this will allow us to all read from
24m42s: the same page and all do the things
24m44s: together so all you need is vs code
24m46s: installed I&amp;#39;ve got VSS code started up
24m48s: here it&amp;#39;s completely blank slate I&amp;#39;ve
24m50s: also got Docker running now one of the
24m53s: uh things in here one of the files is
24m56s: this Docker file
24m58s: this Docker
25m0s: file basically will give all of
25m4s: us the facilities we need the tools that
25m8s: we need that is described effectively on
25m12s: this page on this page here so we will
25m14s: have no JS which is in fact let me put
25m16s: that side by
25m19s: side there there we go we&amp;#39;ve
25m22s: got there we go that&amp;#39;s better uh uh so
25m29s: uh we have um the
25m33s: nodejs image from Microsoft Microsoft
25m36s: container registry it&amp;#39;s the node uh the
25m39s: node 20 uh container image okay and uh
25m44s: we also then install some tools it&amp;#39;s
25m46s: basically based upon I think a
25m50s: Debian a Debian distribution of Linux
25m53s: now the other thing is the other
25m54s: interesting thing is that um the
25m58s: container you will have regardless of
26m0s: your underlying operating system whether
26m2s: it&amp;#39;s Mac OS or Windows or Chrome OS or
26m6s: whatever the operating system that&amp;#39;s
26m9s: running in your container or in your Dev
26m11s: space in sap business application studio
26m14s: is Linux because Linux is everywhere the
26m18s: cloud is just made up of Linux machines
26m20s: okay so the sooner you embrace the one
26m23s: true operating system Unix Linux Etc um
26m26s: that&amp;#39;s my personal opinion of course um
26m29s: the better so we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re using a Debian
26m32s: based operating system you don&amp;#39;t need to
26m33s: know this by the way this is just giving
26m35s: you the background because what I want
26m37s: to do is leave no stone unturned in
26m39s: terms of do this do that do the other I
26m42s: want you to understand what we&amp;#39;re doing
26m45s: by the way um let me know in the
26m48s: comments whether this is interesting
26m50s: useful whether it&amp;#39;s too much information
26m52s: noded enough information um more
26m54s: questions more questions more questions
26m56s: rhl
26m58s: oh is that Red Hat Linux Arif is that
27m0s: Red Hat Linux is what you&amp;#39;re talking
27m1s: about um yeah cool so we&amp;#39;re going to
27m5s: install three tools curl of course you
27m7s: know the command line HTTP client which
27m9s: is awesome git so we can do some uh
27m12s: source code control and SQL light three
27m15s: because at some stage not today at some
27m18s: stage we&amp;#39;re going to want to use SQL
27m22s: light as a persistent store when we&amp;#39;re
27m24s: developing our cap service okay by the
27m28s: way does anybody anybody know why I&amp;#39;m
27m30s: deliberately using the word cap service
27m32s: instead of CAP app okay let me know in
27m35s: the comments and let me know what you
27m37s: think the difference is between a
27m39s: service and an app from a from a
27m41s: microservice perspective from a cloud
27m44s: software or service perspective from a
27m46s: cap perspective from a cap directory
27m48s: perspective there&amp;#39;s a bit of a hint
27m49s: there let me
27m52s: know and then once we&amp;#39;ve installed curl
27m56s: git and SQL lights through three which
27m57s: is the command line tool because then
28m0s: with SQL light 3 we can actually look
28m2s: inside the SQL light database files and
28m4s: say oh there&amp;#39;s a table oh there&amp;#39;s some
28m6s: row rows in that
28m7s: table then we&amp;#39;re going to set the user
28m9s: to nodes because we don&amp;#39;t you know we
28m10s: don&amp;#39;t want to run as root in the
28m12s: container then we&amp;#39;re going to
28m14s: install this thing here okay so for
28m16s: those not familiar with what npm is and
28m20s: what node is so node is effectively
28m22s: JavaScript but it&amp;#39;s JavaScript on the
28m24s: server side and it&amp;#39;s a little bit more
28m26s: than that in terms of you know it&amp;#39;s a
28m28s: it&amp;#39;s a a an asynchronous event based uh
28m32s: engine and there&amp;#39;s a package manager
28m35s: just like there is for many many other
28m37s: languages generally uh so cpan is the
28m41s: package manager or the package system
28m42s: for Pearl and I can&amp;#39;t think of cargo is
28m44s: the package management for rust you know
28m47s: all that sort of thing um so npm node
28m51s: package manager is the package manager
28m52s: for node and the cap engine and tools
28m59s: development tools are all
29m3s: available as an npm package and they&amp;#39;re
29m8s: all prefixed you can see this at sap
29m10s: here at sap this is like a nam space
29m14s: they&amp;#39;re all prefixed with at sap so
29m16s: these are you know you can tell these
29m17s: come from sap if we go to if we were to
29m19s: go to npm I&amp;#39;ve got a little you know
29m23s: Chrome search thing here uh sap fact at
29m29s: sap CDs let&amp;#39;s do SAP CDs first of all
29m32s: and not CDs DK there we go so we&amp;#39;ve got
29m34s: there&amp;#39;s the node package node package
29m36s: nice nice little playful thing here each
29m38s: time you go there it&amp;#39;s got a little
29m39s: different different meaning for mpm
29m41s: nitrogen peroxide monoxide what it going
29m43s: to say next refresh oh maybe it doesn&amp;#39;t
29m46s: change I don&amp;#39;t know who knows um cap so
29m49s: uh utash says cap services are
29m51s: microservices an app is a service and
29m53s: yes exactly I mean an app is a Services
29m54s: an app is a Services an app what I in my
29m58s: brain when I say service a cap service
30m0s: I&amp;#39;m thinking headless I&amp;#39;m thinking a
30m2s: service with no front end with no guey
30m6s: with
30m7s: no uii fiori view react angular whatever
30m13s: web front end I&amp;#39;m just thinking of a
30m14s: service in terms of for example a no
30m17s: data service a headless service that
30m19s: then other things can attach to and
30m22s: consume okay and with
30m24s: cap quite often folks use cap to build
30m29s: headless services but also cap has the
30m31s: facility to allow you to put together a
30m34s: front end and Cat will also serve that
30m38s: okay especially when you&amp;#39;re building and
30m40s: uh in in this sort of tight Loop
30m43s: development cycle locally and we&amp;#39;ll see
30m45s: that with the different the three
30m47s: different folders this there&amp;#39;s a
30m48s: hierarchy the the
30m50s: triumvirate of of uh folders of
30m52s: directories app serve and DB so we&amp;#39;ll
30m55s: come on to that
30m57s: okay so here we go we can see sap CDs
31m0s: and there&amp;#39;s also sap oh Rising there we
31m2s: go hey hey Martin sap CDs and um Sab CDs
31m8s: DK okay Sab Cloud application programing
31m10s: model I to hit search sap CDs
31m14s: DK there we go a direct hit now the
31m19s: difference between sap CDs and sap cdsd
31m22s: K notice here there&amp;#39;s sap sap Cloud
31m25s: application programming model CDs for
31m27s: node.js
31m28s: think of this package as the package you
31m33s: need the runtime package the
31m35s: lean fat free cap runtime package okay
31m41s: so when you deploy your application to
31m43s: the
31m46s: cloud your cap service is going to need
31m50s: uh Lu yeah do I need to install
31m52s: something do yes you need to yeah Docker
31m54s: you need to install Docker
31m55s: desktop and V s code and that&amp;#39;s it you
31m58s: don&amp;#39;t need to install node npm git
32m2s: anything else just dock a desktop and vs
32m5s: code and that gives us the beauty of
32m8s: abstracting everything so you&amp;#39;re not
32m9s: messing up your own personal computer
32m12s: your laptop whatever with stuff that you
32m14s: don&amp;#39;t want otherwise okay so this is the
32m19s: the lean fat free
32m21s: runtime for when your servic is running
32m23s: in the cloud but for when you&amp;#39;re
32m26s: developing you want all of that lean
32m28s: fat-free run time plus the extra fat and
32m31s: the extra goodness and the beauty and
32m33s: the
32m34s: tools that allow you to develop in the
32m37s: most efficient way
32m39s: possible can anybody tell so a classic
32m42s: for those who have been
32m44s: developing with cap already there&amp;#39;s a
32m48s: command that you run when you&amp;#39;re sort of
32m50s: halfway through development and you sort
32m51s: of you know you&amp;#39;re in this sort of flow
32m54s: of making modifications and seeing those
32m56s: ch changes in your service but you run
33m0s: this this this CDs command CDs
33m3s: something what is that command that you
33m6s: run that command the one I&amp;#39;m thinking of
33m8s: the one I&amp;#39;m hoping somebody will say
33m10s: that
33m11s: command is part of sap CDs DK is part of
33m16s: the development kit because it makes no
33m17s: sense to have that restarting command
33m21s: this sort of development type Loop cycle
33m23s: in the cloud when your appap is just
33m25s: running headless service
33m28s: so there&amp;#39;s the difference the CDs DK is
33m30s: a development kit with CDs in it but
33m34s: lots of other tools and then sap CDs
33m37s: itself is just the sort of the the run
33m40s: time version does that make sense I&amp;#39;ve
33m41s: got a bit overboard there okay but what
33m43s: we need to do because we&amp;#39;re going to be
33m45s: developing we want to install the sap
33m46s: CDs DK hasita welcome hasita one of the
33m52s: uh many lovely people who uh partook and
33m55s: was very vocal which is brilliant in the
33m58s: uh developer challenge API in fact one
34m0s: of the uh uh one of the superheroes
34m2s: there fantastic CDs W exactly maybe
34m6s: maybe we we need a command so that I
34m9s: don&amp;#39;t know the more A&amp;#39;s you have in
34m11s: watch you know the more things it looks
34m13s: at to check whether things have changed
34m16s: to restart I&amp;#39;m quite cool hey hello to
34m20s: you in
34m22s: bangalo once we&amp;#39;ve installed csdk that&amp;#39;s
34m25s: it okay so this sets up a container with
34m29s: everything you need with all this stuff
34m32s: in it okay and also the beautiful thing
34m36s: is you&amp;#39;ve also not only got the
34m38s: container definition but you&amp;#39;ve also got
34m40s: this sort of thing that tells vs code
34m44s: that how to use this container okay so
34m46s: Back to Basics sa cap Dev container it
34m49s: tells you where the the docker file is
34m51s: which is the file we&amp;#39;ve just looked at
34m53s: but it also oh got horrible spacing
34m55s: there sorry about that um it also tells
34m58s: vs code what extensions to install now
35m2s: if we go down here install Visual Studio
35m5s: code from code.com it will also tell you
35m11s: or recommend some extensions so one of
35m14s: the reasons for using vs
35m16s: code is because there&amp;#39;s a CDS language
35m21s: support
35m23s: extension that helps you at ton with
35m26s: devel in cap services and cap
35m28s: applications we&amp;#39;ll be using that and
35m30s: looking at that so it&amp;#39;ll gives you it&amp;#39;ll
35m32s: give you linting it&amp;#39;ll give you hints
35m33s: it&amp;#39;ll give you formatting color coding
35m36s: all that sort of stuff okay that&amp;#39;s
35m37s: that&amp;#39;s that okay so that&amp;#39;s why that&amp;#39;s um
35m41s: recommended es lint is a more General
35m44s: sort of you know linter that will lint
35m46s: JavaScript okay linting is basically you
35m48s: know Finding issues and saying oh by the
35m50s: way you should do this and don&amp;#39;t do that
35m51s: and that&amp;#39;s wrong and bad practice etc
35m53s: etc so ah yeah so Arif Arif is is he
35m57s: hammering these uh these in here hoping
35m59s: to get one of them that&amp;#39;s fantastic yes
36m1s: AR a CDS watch CDs deploy as well I
36m3s: think as arguably a development kit tool
36m5s: as well uh so yeah so exactly so CDs
36m9s: watch is what I was sort of aiming for
36m11s: or thinking about because it&amp;#39;s a
36m14s: developer it&amp;#39;s something you do as a
36m15s: developer you know I want to watch this
36m17s: thing I want you know and have the cap
36m19s: server restart
36m21s: automatically because I want to see my
36m23s: the the effect of my changes as I&amp;#39;m
36m25s: developing as fast as possible the
36m27s: documentation the Capa documentation
36m29s: talks a lot about this sort of tight
36m31s: development Loop cycle thing uh which is
36m34s: brilliant so it also installs uh it also
36m37s: recommends es lint uh so AB I think dock
36m41s: desktop is something new now as early it
36m43s: was not part of ah okay so let me be
36m45s: clear Docker and Docker desktop is not
36m48s: part of a cap project this is my
36m51s: recommendation my personal DJ
36m53s: recommendation for you if you want to
36m55s: play around with this you don&amp;#39;t have to
36m56s: use Docker you can install all the tools
36m58s: you can install all the tools as normal
37m1s: as in uh where&amp;#39;s where&amp;#39;s the list here
37m3s: node.js the npm package CD SDK you got
37m6s: you can install git you can install SQL
37m7s: lights and so on right and you may also
37m11s: want to install other tools that help
37m13s: you more generally with development like
37m15s: the watch command or I don&amp;#39;t know can&amp;#39;t
37m18s: think of anything off the top of my head
37m20s: you don&amp;#39;t need dock a desktop for cap at
37m23s: all it&amp;#39;s only if you want to tread as
37m26s: lightest possible on your own
37m28s: machine and also partake of this sort of
37m32s: shared experience where we&amp;#39;re all
37m34s: working in exactly the same environment
37m38s: okay that&amp;#39;s all you could you can you
37m40s: can develop a cap without Docker without
37m42s: containers at all okay just let me be
37m45s: let me be clear AET yeah do that does
37m47s: that make
37m48s: sense I&amp;#39;m
37m51s: just conveying this as the simplest way
37m54s: and the the the most light footed way of
37m57s: starting so in here we can say in this
38m0s: Dev container. Json I would like in my
38m4s: container that we connect to from vs
38m6s: code this this extension the Cs language
38m10s: support the eslint extension if you go
38m13s: for example to es lint here why what&amp;#39;s
38m15s: what the heck is this name here D Bo
38m18s: Boer vs code es lint that is
38m21s: because there we go there&amp;#39;s es lint if
38m23s: you have a look at the actual technical
38m25s: name
38m27s: that&amp;#39;s the name of the actual extension
38m29s: so if we go to hum rest
38m31s: client there if I put that there will
38m34s: this work probably will do let&amp;#39;s have a
38m36s: look Bang there there that is
38m41s: also rest L there that&amp;#39;s the rest client
38m43s: and so on and SQL like viewer okay fine
38m46s: uh there&amp;#39;s the SQL like viewer and also
38m48s: rainbow CSV to color code you know color
38m50s: different Columns of CSV when we&amp;#39;re
38m52s: looking at
38m53s: CSV pathy exactly so pathy ask a
38m56s: brilliant question is bass enough
38m58s: instead of all these tools uh bass is
39m0s: enough in that in fact yeah in that um
39m4s: the business application Studio Let&amp;#39;s do
39m5s: let&amp;#39;s go let&amp;#39;s go there let me go to my
39m6s: trial account uh the business
39m8s: application studio is available to all
39m10s: folks having a trial
39m13s: account okay ABG brilliant no problem at
39m16s: all this is exactly what I I love and I
39m18s: want you to do this all the time ABJ
39m20s: asks a brilliant question
39m23s: okay it wasn&amp;#39;t obvious to abjet or to
39m26s: maybe other folks as well so ask the
39m28s: question fantastic fantastic fantastic
39m30s: fantastic okay instances and
39m32s: subscriptions I can&amp;#39;t even say it um
39m35s: I&amp;#39;ve got a subscription to the business
39m36s: application studio in my trial account
39m37s: you can get trial account as well for
39m39s: free and um you you can get access to
39m41s: the business application
39m42s: studio so let me go in and answer that
39m46s: question from parthy because I think is
39m48s: really important so let me to create a
39m48s: new depth space so I can say uh cap B2B
39m52s: for example full stack Cloud application
39m55s: right in fact let me make a full screen
39m57s: you can see here that the full stack
39m59s: Cloud application Dev space gives us all
40m2s: these predefined tools and we can also
40m4s: choose some additional extensions if we
40m6s: were for example to want to develop uh a
40m9s: cap service with an sap hand cloud back
40m12s: end we might want to install some sap
40m14s: hand tools we won&amp;#39;t do that now we also
40m16s: have a code on that by the way we won&amp;#39;t
40m17s: do that now we&amp;#39;ll just create a step
40m19s: space in fact I should have pressed that
40m20s: button before talking anymore because it
40m22s: takes a few minutes to do that so why
40m23s: let&amp;#39;s remind me uh let me don&amp;#39;t need
40m26s: that let me delete that one anyway so
40m28s: Pary remind me in a couple of seconds to
40m30s: to come back
40m32s: here and uh see if the dev space is
40m34s: started but meanwhile we&amp;#39;ll go through
40m36s: so that finally can anybody tell me and
40m40s: again lots of people will know this
40m41s: answer but that&amp;#39;s the whole point right
40m43s: can anybody tell me what this is all
40m45s: about forward ports
40m49s: 404 I&amp;#39;m going to wait for a second and
40m52s: tell me in the chat what that means by
40m54s: the way while I&amp;#39;m waiting I&amp;#39;ve got this
40m56s: box out one of the very early Amazing
41m0s: Friends of hands onb
41m5s: Dev excuse me Mr Ronnie
41m8s: sletter developed some amazing stickers
41m11s: so we have the original handson Hands-On
41m15s: ASB Dev stickers for your laptop so in
41m18s: fact
41m20s: um lots of folks uh have these and we&amp;#39;ve
41m25s: also got some new stickers relatively
41m28s: new stickers based upon can anybody tell
41m31s: me what that computer is based
41m34s: upon this amazing PC home computer
41m38s: whatever with hands on SB Dev and it
41m40s: says 10 learn 20 share 30 grow 40 go to
41m45s: 10 there&amp;#39;s a history behind that why
41m47s: that says that so and also we also have
41m51s: lots of these developers developers.
41m53s: sep.com stickers so here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s the
41m57s: thing oh I&amp;#39;ve also got some batches as
41m59s: well look at
42m0s: that slh hobble mode in AB up and uh
42m6s: what&amp;#39;s this one eat sleep
42m8s: code eat sleep code no repeat I don&amp;#39;t
42m10s: know why it&amp;#39;s no repeat anyway eat sleep
42m13s: code if anybody would like me to send
42m16s: them through the
42m17s: post some
42m20s: stickers we I used to say send me a
42m22s: direct message on Twitter I&amp;#39;m not on
42m24s: Twitter anymore so instead
42m26s: find me on LinkedIn and send me a direct
42m29s: message on LinkedIn and then we can chat
42m31s: and you can give me a a PO a postal
42m33s: address to send the things too I&amp;#39;ll send
42m35s: you a few stickers it might take a while
42m36s: for me to get to the post office because
42m37s: I&amp;#39;m obviously on a boat uh but I&amp;#39;ll send
42m40s: them okay doesn&amp;#39;t matter where you are
42m41s: in the world I&amp;#39;ll send them uh so let me
42m44s: know okay so you&amp;#39;ll find me on LinkedIn
42m46s: I&amp;#39;m sure uh so there we go Okay so we&amp;#39;ve
42m49s: got some answers here uh K Steeler says
42m52s: for the internal container port to the
42m53s: external service perfect that&amp;#39;s a
42m55s: beautiful
42m56s: succinct uh and perfect answer from a
42m59s: Docker container perspective so
43m0s: obviously when something is listening
43m3s: it&amp;#39;s bound to a socket and listening on
43m4s: that Port Port 404 in this case inside
43m7s: the container you can&amp;#39;t from your actual
43m10s: PC my Mac OS machine here for example I
43m12s: can&amp;#39;t connect to that socket I can&amp;#39;t go
43m14s: there so this is saying expose that Port
43m18s: 404 to the host machine to my Mac OS
43m21s: machine so I can in my web browser
43m23s: Chrome go there okay and Arif says by
43m27s: affording Port 404 you can access the
43m29s: running application in your web browser
43m30s: exactly right uh helmet you can find me
43m32s: on Master on as well exactly send me a
43m34s: private message on masteron if you want
43m35s: as well in fact masteron there we go
43m38s: that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s uh where&amp;#39;s me how do I go
43m41s: to my profile ah there we go there
43m43s: there&amp;#39;s my profile I&amp;#39;m Mastered on uh
43m46s: there so uh yeah I&amp;#39;ve um that&amp;#39;s DJ by
43m48s: the way me um I&amp;#39;ve moved away from
43m51s: Twitter and I&amp;#39;m now master I encourage
43m53s: you to join masteron and Helmont you can
43m55s: tell people more more about your amazing
43m57s: server on masteron if people want to
43m58s: don&amp;#39;t know where to join and
44m0s: everything so there we go uh we don&amp;#39;t
44m2s: need that we don&amp;#39;t need that but the key
44m5s: thing is the key thing is 404 is a very
44m9s: cap specific Port okay it you know it&amp;#39;s
44m12s: just a randomly selected Port by you
44m14s: know caps bdfl benevolent dictator for
44m17s: life it could be any you know any High
44m19s: numbered Port but Daniel Cho Daniel hell
44m23s: chose
44m24s: 404 Maybe next week I&amp;#39;ll tell you why he
44m27s: chose 4,000 I think some people know I
44m28s: think I&amp;#39;ve said this before but it&amp;#39;s a
44m30s: very interesting non-technical reason
44m32s: why he chose Port 4,000 or4 so for
44m35s: example you
44m36s: know uh you might have a local web
44m38s: server listening up 8,000 doing things
44m40s: you know whatever you know that what&amp;#39;s
44m41s: the default Port of engin X I can&amp;#39;t
44m43s: remember I seem to remember that um Ruby
44m45s: on Rails I used to program with Ruby on
44m47s: Rails and that default Port was like in
44m49s: the three something series 3,000 anyway
44m52s: doesn&amp;#39;t really matter but 404 when you
44m54s: see 404 that&amp;#39;s sort of caps default
44m57s: local Port okay
45m0s: so let me get to the place where just
45m4s: register I will let you in yes but hel
45m6s: oh um I think did you try and put a URL
45m9s: in there um I&amp;#39;m not
45m12s: sure the UR didn&amp;#39;t didn&amp;#39;t appear so let
45m15s: me put the URL in is it uh sapad on.org
45m17s: there we go that&amp;#39;s sapad on.org I&amp;#39;ll put
45m19s: it in there Bang there um maybe it
45m22s: filtered out or something I don&amp;#39;t know
45m24s: um so there sat on you can create an
45m27s: account there so helmet is very kindly
45m29s: running out for us
45m31s: so this thing here if we now go here let
45m35s: me close that close that oh it&amp;#39;s running
45m37s: there we go so go back to pathy you
45m39s: didn&amp;#39;t remind me come on Pary pay
45m41s: attention just one more moment your
45m43s: velopment is starting to open about to
45m45s: open so what I can do what we can all do
45m48s: here let me just do that here as well
45m49s: what we can all do is go to cat B2B
45m54s: again try not to use G git because we
45m56s: don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t want to require to install
45m58s: git we can say download zip okay and you
46m1s: can download the zip file which should
46m2s: download these
46m3s: files download zip I&amp;#39;ve already
46m5s: downloaded it
46m6s: there and then I&amp;#39;ve also there it is
46m9s: there
46m12s: um Let me let me clean that out okay so
46m15s: now I can say unzip let&amp;#39;s have what&amp;#39;s in
46m18s: it first of all C you don&amp;#39;t need to use
46m20s: a command line tool to do this you can
46m21s: do it with a you know a normal you know
46m24s: gooey zip thing if you really want to
46m26s: but all it&amp;#39;s got is exactly the content
46m28s: of what&amp;#39;s in that git repo so I&amp;#39;m going
46m30s: to say unzip uh that and it&amp;#39;s going to
46m34s: unzip it into a directory called CAP btb
46m36s: dmain so if we have a look now CD cap
46m39s: btb D main what we&amp;#39;ve got in there is
46m41s: the read me but if we look at all of it
46m43s: in fact Let me show let me show you in a
46m44s: a normal thing because this is a Back to
46m47s: Basics there we go scratch cat B2B main
46m50s: we go in there and then I don&amp;#39;t know why
46m53s: I can&amp;#39;t set this as a setting can I set
46m54s: this as a setting um there we can show
46m57s: the hidden files the ones beginning with
46m58s: Dot and we&amp;#39;ve got those two files that
47m0s: we looked at there then once you&amp;#39;ve
47m4s: downloaded this ZIP file okay so you can
47m6s: go to um where is it again uh go to not
47m10s: there go to
47m12s: there which is Cap
47m14s: B2B uh where there cap B2B fatty hello
47m19s: to you in Istanbul hello hello hello go
47m23s: there and download it unpack it and
47m29s: then start up vs code so in fact I&amp;#39;m
47m32s: going to close vs code start up vs code
47m38s: okay now one of the things you will need
47m41s: in vs code
47m44s: is the dev containers
47m47s: extension let me um go there Dev
47m51s: containers
47m54s: there install the dev containers
47m56s: extension so
47m58s: that okay so that you have access
48m2s: to this thing down here right it goes
48m5s: like that if I click
48m7s: that we have all these different
48m10s: facilities to open remote resources but
48m13s: all I&amp;#39;m going to do for
48m15s: now is do the simplest thing that could
48m18s: possibly work let&amp;#39;s get rid of this
48m19s: extensions thing and say open folder
48m23s: okay I use the word directory all the
48m25s: time
48m27s: vs code uses folder I think a lot of sap
48m29s: literature uses folder as well as some
48m31s: maybe a I don&amp;#39;t know a more windows I
48m32s: thing I don&amp;#39;t know so directory folder
48m36s: same thing okay open folder now I&amp;#39;m
48m38s: going to
48m39s: open that folder okay that directory cap
48m43s: bb-
48m45s: main now what does it say it says here
48m49s: the folder can oh the folder contains a
48m50s: Dev container configuration file reopen
48m52s: folder to develop in a container
48m54s: reopening container okay so what&amp;#39;s
48m56s: happened is vs code has opened that
48m59s: directory it&amp;#39;s seen the readme file but
49m1s: it&amp;#39;s also seen this wellknown don&amp;#39;t need
49m4s: that one this
49m5s: well-known directory name called doev
49m8s: container okay it&amp;#39;s actually it&amp;#39;s
49m10s: actually now an open standard by the way
49m12s: Dev sorry
49m15s: containers containers dodev containers
49m18s: dodev amazing a there&amp;#39;s so much stuff to
49m21s: learn here um and what that&amp;#39;s done is
49m25s: it&amp;#39;s Rec recognized oh there&amp;#39;s AEV
49m27s: container directory here let me look in
49m30s: there and let me offer the user DJ the
49m34s: ability to restart or reopen that
49m37s: directory so that you&amp;#39;re working inside
49m39s: a container with that directory attached
49m43s: okay so now because in the container
49m48s: definition we look in Dev container
49m53s: here I&amp;#39;ve got it to install curl git and
49m57s: SQL light three let&amp;#39;s just try to
50m1s: see
50m3s: curl there it is
50m5s: get there it is SQL light three there it
50m10s: is so we&amp;#39;ve now got all the tools inside
50m12s: the container now I don&amp;#39;t know whether I
50m14s: I don&amp;#39;t know whether I&amp;#39;ve
50m18s: got uh curl I&amp;#39;ve got Cur I&amp;#39;ve got curl
50m21s: obviously I install curl everywhere git
50m23s: I&amp;#39;ve got git here as well but you might
50m24s: not have SQL light three I&amp;#39;ve got SQL
50m27s: light three there as well okay fine but
50m30s: that&amp;#39;s me you may not have any of those
50m32s: things on your actual local machine
50m34s: that&amp;#39;s the whole point of doing this in
50m36s: a container so you don&amp;#39;t need to install
50m38s: it on your local
50m39s: machine what else have we got though
50m41s: what else have we
50m42s: got the most exciting
50m46s: thing we&amp;#39;ve got the result of this thing
50m50s: here we&amp;#39;ve actually we&amp;#39;ve even got node
50m51s: let me go here right we&amp;#39;ve got node good
50m54s: morning Javier and welcome old friend
50m56s: from the live stream fantastic good
50m58s: morning good morning good morning so
51m0s: we&amp;#39;ve also got n node there we go we&amp;#39;ve
51m4s: got node 20 just as
51m7s: our definition our Docker file
51m9s: definition
51m11s: specified okay there&amp;#39;s that variant sort
51m13s: of you know
51m16s: substituted not only that mpm list
51m22s: Global so I&amp;#39;ve said show me the packages
51m26s: that are
51m27s: installed
51m29s: globally and look we&amp;#39;ve got CD SDK PN PM
51m34s: I have no idea what that is maybe it&amp;#39;s
51m36s: maybe it was installed because CD SDK
51m38s: needed them I don&amp;#39;t
51m40s: know but the key thing is we&amp;#39;ve got CDs
51m44s: DK installed so we&amp;#39;ve got everything we
51m46s: need now oh volume volume up please oh
51m49s: right okay volume up I&amp;#39;ll move this
51m51s: microphone here is anybody else maybe
51m53s: maybe try your volume uh bis M as well
51m56s: but people let me know if the volume is
51m58s: no good people let me know if the the
52m1s: the resolution is no good the old uh the
52m5s: old friends of the channel will know
52m6s: that I want you to tell me if anything
52m9s: wrong if I can do anything better so I&amp;#39;m
52m11s: going to move a bit closer to the
52m12s: microphone let me know if that&amp;#39;s better
52m14s: BM but also try and turn your volume up
52m16s: too uh and see if that

52m34s: uh volume is good thanks AP volume is
52m35s: good loud and clear Daniel oh my
52m37s: goodness
52m38s: ah so no pressure
52m42s: but this this is always this always

52m46s: many superheroes in the cap team it&amp;#39;s
52m47s: like oh my God better not say anything
52m49s: wrong I don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m do I don&amp;#39;t

52m56s: so the drum roll somebody give me a drum
52m59s: roll I&amp;#39;m not sure how you give me a drum
53m0s: roll in the chat but the drum
53m1s: roll thing is that in this
53m8s: container ah yeah let let me do this
53m10s: right here is my Mac OS machine right if
53m13s: I say CDs command not found CDs CDs is
53m19s: basically the command line tool that you
53m21s: will use for developing your cap service
53m24s: your cap app does everything it&amp;#39;s
53m26s: amazing right we&amp;#39;re going to be
53m27s: discovering all the things about cap
53m29s: through the magic of the CDs command
53m32s: line tool okay you&amp;#39;ll see it actually
53m35s: here uh there we no uh if we go back to
53m39s: um there go to get started we&amp;#39;re going
53m42s: to be hopefully before I stop ra when I
53m44s: stop rambling right we&amp;#39;re going to do
53m46s: CDs init Bookshop okay 10 minutes right
53m49s: got 10
53m50s: minutes I haven&amp;#39;t got CDs on my local
53m52s: Mac machine but I have got CDs yes da
53m58s: on in vs C because I&amp;#39;m inside my
54m1s: container oh thank you P padara padara
54m4s: sorry padara thank you padara excellent
54m7s: drum roll there so we now have the power
54m10s: of cap and our
54m12s: fingertips so we can now start also let
54m17s: me know in the chat if you&amp;#39;re if you
54m20s: already have done or you&amp;#39;re planning
54m22s: either now or between now and next
54m23s: Friday when we&amp;#39;re going to carry on with
54m24s: this this okay this is going to be a
54m27s: multi episode series and that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m
54m30s: deliberately allowing myself to sort of
54m32s: ramble a little bit and make sure we
54m33s: cover all the ground as we&amp;#39;re moving
54m35s: very
54m37s: slowly because you know we this is like
54m39s: almost not quite but an
54m42s: open-ended series of episodes okay this
54m44s: is for you and me to find out together
54m48s: all about the basics of cap right
54m53s: fantastic thank you AP as well
54m56s: so let&amp;#39;s go to here so if we go to
55m0s: capier again cap get started we don&amp;#39;t
55m4s: need to go through jump start
55m4s: development because that&amp;#39;s all about
55m5s: setting up the tools which you&amp;#39;ve done
55m6s: already and this also then also tells
55m8s: you about jump starting in fact let&amp;#39;s do
55m11s: this let&amp;#39;s do this because we want to
55m13s: explore this this documentation page CDs
55m16s: init
55m17s: Bookshop
55m19s: now let me make that one smaller maybe
55m22s: and let me move I know my head&amp;#39;s over
55m24s: there but that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s proba fine isn&amp;#39;t
55m25s: it oh by the

55m51s: so thank you Nico for all that it&amp;#39;s
55m53s: fantastic so CD c s init Bookshop but
55m57s: before we do that let&amp;#39;s say CDs init
56m0s: d-el okay help is your friend d-el and
56m3s: this gives
56m5s: us uh there we go let&amp;#39;s move that across
56m7s: here it&amp;#39;s a bit too small isn&amp;#39;t it let&amp;#39;s
56m9s: go back and make it a bit bigger and
56m11s: just scroll scroll up and
56m12s: down so what are we doing when with CDs
56m15s: in it okay because CDs the CDs command
56m18s: line tool does a lot of
56m22s: things it for example will do a onetime
56m26s: activity like initialize a project which
56m29s: we&amp;#39;re doing here but it will also when
56m32s: we give it the right command sub command
56m34s: let&amp;#39;s call it it will also start up and
56m37s: run an actual cap server okay I&amp;#39;m using
56m42s: the word server instead of service here
56m45s: oh I thought you giving yourself clap
56m46s: but that&amp;#39;s a thank you isn&amp;#39;t it yeah
56m48s: nice one Nico
56m50s: um so here what we&amp;#39;re saying is CDS init
56m54s: Bookshop initializes a new project in
56m57s: the folder project okay so it&amp;#39;ll take
57m0s: CDs in it Bookshop and it&amp;#39;ll create a
57m2s: new folder I&amp;#39;m going to use I don&amp;#39;t like
57m4s: using the word folder but I&amp;#39;ll use the
57m5s: word folder because you know get with
57m7s: the program DJ um in the in the folder
57m10s: called whatever you say with the current
57m12s: working directory as default if we don&amp;#39;t
57m14s: do anything else that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s going
57m17s: to do we&amp;#39;re going to play around with
57m18s: these add features in a minute okay but
57m21s: we can go from zero to superhero oh
57m26s: L thank you for asking that question so
57m28s: Lu is saying I&amp;#39;m a little bit confused
57m30s: sorry you are running vs code inside of
57m32s: dock desktop no what I&amp;#39;m doing but
57m34s: that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s
57m36s: easily what something somebody might
57m38s: think I&amp;#39;m running vs code on my Mac
57m40s: machine if I scroll through the you know
57m43s: apps on my Mac OS I&amp;#39;m running VSS code
57m46s: I&amp;#39;m running a terminal I&amp;#39;m running
57m48s: Chrome I&amp;#39;m running stream lasts desktop
57m49s: for this live stream I&amp;#39;m running slack
57m51s: because of because slack um so I&amp;#39;m
57m54s: running running vs code natively on my
57m57s: Mac OS computer here there right but the
58m3s: vs code itself is connected to a
58m7s: container image okay if I go to here you
58m10s: can see there&amp;#39;s a container called keen
58m12s: banak and it&amp;#39;s got this vs vs code so
58m16s: it&amp;#39;s basically I&amp;#39;ll show you here it&amp;#39;s
58m17s: easier
58m18s: Docker uh container LS oops Docker
58m24s: container l s there so that&amp;#39;s this thing
58m27s: here by the way this sort of nice
58m29s: display of containers images volumes and
58m31s: networks and everything that is called
58m33s: lazy Docker so that is that that one let
58m36s: me make it smaller so we can get it on
58m38s: one line that&amp;#39;s lazy team lazy Docker
58m41s: the other container that&amp;#39;s running is
58m44s: the container that vs code started up
58m47s: when it
58m49s: saw the dodev container directory in the
58m52s: folder in the directory opened and what
58m54s: vs code did is create a new container
58m59s: that&amp;#39;s the container it
59m1s: created
59m3s: there based upon which image the image
59m6s: that was described in the dev container
59m9s: Jason so that&amp;#39;s the contain that this is
59m12s: the the docker file itself but the dev
59m14s: container Jason says create a container
59m16s: based on the information in that Docker
59m18s: file okay does that make sense
59m23s: perfect yeah I was I was I&amp;#39;ve got to say
59m26s: I was wondering about whether this would
59m28s: be a little bit of a bumpy start but
59m30s: once we once we started in containers
59m32s: then everything we can do we don&amp;#39;t you
59m34s: know we don&amp;#39;t have any vagaries or
59m35s: weirdness oh I can&amp;#39;t install this on my
59m37s: machine or oh this is not working I got
59m38s: the wrong version of node or whatever we
59m40s: all have the same version of node we all
59m42s: have the same version of mpm we all have
59m43s: the same version of cap blah blah blah
59m45s: blah all the same experience right and
59m47s: it&amp;#39;s exactly the same oh yes here we go
59m49s: uh where&amp;#39;s the where&amp;#39;s the um oh it&amp;#39;s
59m51s: here isn&amp;#39;t it um there get started so
59m55s: parthy was it pathy ask about this so
59m57s: I&amp;#39;ve got a Dev space if I open up a
60m0s: terminal um there we go user CDs there
60m4s: we go we&amp;#39;ve also got CDs that it&amp;#39;s Cap&amp;#39;s
60m6s: everywhere cap is everywhere so we&amp;#39;ve
60m8s: got CDs there as well so if you want you
60m10s: can do it in a Dev space on sap business
60m13s: application you we&amp;#39;ve also got you know
60m15s: because Dev because the dev spaces are
60m16s: pretty cool you&amp;#39;ve got git already
60m18s: you&amp;#39;ve got Cur so you&amp;#39;ve got also you
60m20s: got all the tools there as well have we
60m21s: got SQL light three yes you got SQL
60m24s: light three as well so you could you
60m25s: could do it like this instead in fact
60m28s: before we uh before we close off that
60m31s: idea if we go to here you could
60m34s: also in GitHub open up a code space in
60m38s: fact I just opened up a code space based
60m41s: upon this repo redesigned potato what a
60m43s: brilliant name so let&amp;#39;s just let that
60m45s: run as well so you could do it in a
60m47s: GitHub code space as well it&amp;#39;s all the
60m49s: same right it&amp;#39;s a container so that is
60m52s: no worries it got I&amp;#39;ll just close it
60m53s: that is a container
60m57s: where is it h this is a container look
60m58s: it&amp;#39;s a code space and it looks like it
61m0s: looks like a de space
61m2s: in business application you do because
61m4s: that&amp;#39;s exactly the same thing right it&amp;#39;s
61m6s: okay so there we go so this is in on
61m9s: GitHub so once we get terminal once it
61m10s: starts up opening remote and everything
61m12s: you know it&amp;#39;s all the same thing it&amp;#39;s
61m14s: all in a container right so uh there we
61m17s: go so we can do that so if we let&amp;#39;s do
61m19s: that right so let&amp;#39;s close open screen uh
61m22s: open close clear the screen so CDs init
61m25s: Bookshop let&amp;#39;s do that and see what
61m28s: happens right so one of the things I
61m30s: want to do is read through all of the uh
61m36s: log lines the output so we understand
61m38s: everything adding feature no J so if we
61m41s: CDs in it
61m44s: help there add one or more features
61m47s: while creating the project okay and by
61m49s: default it will create because you know
61m51s: because we&amp;#39;re sort of running in a no
61m53s: context I guess but anyway it will it
61m54s: will will
61m57s: create or add this feature no. JS okay
62m0s: so if you wanted to create a javab base
62m1s: project you&amp;#39;d say CDs in its um Bookshop
62m6s: do-- add Java okay and there&amp;#39;s all sorts
62m10s: of features here which we&amp;#39;ll look into
62m11s: over the course of the next few episodes
62m13s: it&amp;#39;s amazing it&amp;#39;s amazing right so so
62m15s: what&amp;#39;s that done okay it has
62m19s: created a directory called Bookshop in
62m22s: there it&amp;#39;s created the trium of
62m25s: directories app serve and DB I had a
62m27s: conversation with um I think it was
62m28s: Daniel actually it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s so
62m30s: unfortunate that the names of these mean
62m33s: that they&amp;#39;re not in the order my brain
62m34s: thinks of them thinks of them
62m37s: right
62m38s: so the final thing the final thing and
62m42s: we&amp;#39;ll look at these directories next
62m43s: week but if I say CDs watch which is a
62m46s: CDS DK subcommand okay what happens
62m49s: right CDs watch startup but there&amp;#39;s
62m52s: nothing there right there&amp;#39;s nothing for
62m54s: it to serve right no models found and
62m56s: we&amp;#39;ll look at the details of what this
62m58s: means and what we can do in fact let&amp;#39;s
63m1s: do one final thing split terminal let&amp;#39;s
63m3s: open up another terminal so we&amp;#39;re still
63m4s: watching here if we say CDs add
63m9s: d-el we can see that we can add things
63m13s: to our current project so if we say CDs

64m22s: data my Bookshop books in Heights and
64m24s: Jane air it&amp;#39;s even given given us a
64m27s: service definition we&amp;#39;ll look into what
64m28s: this means and it also means that we can
64m30s: now go to Local Host 404 and we have
64m34s: without lifting a finger hardly a fully
64m37s: functioning V4 o data service there&amp;#39;s
64m39s: the metadata oh my goodness me so let&amp;#39;s
64m42s: stop
64m43s: here uh amazing amazing comment from K

65m1s: to dig into what just happened okay so
65m3s: between now and then between now and
65m6s: then get yourself set up either in
65m9s: business application studio in a Dev
65m10s: space or clone this repo and set up a um
65m14s: where is it gone I don&amp;#39;t know ah set up
65m16s: a thing oh there we go so this is on
65m17s: GitHub look CDs bang done you can do it
