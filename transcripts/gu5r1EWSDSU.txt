good morning good afternoon good evening
welcome to handson sap Dev with me DJ
qro it&amp;#39;s great to be back it&amp;#39;s been a
long time so thank you everybody for
joining this first live stream of
2024 so uh hi to V vadir is an old
friend of the stream and lots of Old
Friends actually so uh Lu have you got
your large mug of coffee ready it&amp;#39;s 5 a.
at your time isn&amp;#39;t it bom di to you guda
to Thomas and Bones Diaz Antonio my
friend and colleague Antonio Santiago
bues Diaz Michael good morning helmet mo
mo to
brke Brunswick in North Germany Abu hi
to AB in Bangalore welcome everybody
this is this is amazing good morning
Henry
so so I apologize I&amp;#39;m just recovering
from
um oh dear two or three weeks of flu and
you know what I&amp;#39;ve been getting up in
the morning and I you know I uh I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m
on my own on the boat here the narrow
boat of M I&amp;#39;ll explain a little bit more
about that in a second but because I&amp;#39;ve
not I&amp;#39;ve not spoken a word this morning
you know as soon as you start
speaking I don&amp;#39;t know you get ill again
I don&amp;#39;t know hey hello hello hello Chik
CH uh sorry sorry chakia chakia is that
how you pronounce your name I I probably
butchered that to death Stefano good
morning to Barcelona madav good morning
arif&amp;#39;s learning Arif learning lab hello
in Bangkok as well hello DJ DJ the OG
that&amp;#39;s quite hard to say and Matias
Matias how&amp;#39;s the sticker game going on
your laptop I think I think Matias
always uh always impresses me with the
number of stickers on his huge laptop
good morning to Matias in Dortmund I&amp;#39;m
super excited um this is like I say the
first uh the first live stream of 2024
we&amp;#39;re back with a vengeance and uh we
got a new design uh you know new scenes
and layouts thanks to another one of my
wonderful friends and colleagues Nico sh
um and oh good morning darid and Lucas
good morning to Poland excellent abet as
well oh AB good to see you as well uh so
fantastic
now um what oh yeah just want I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m
broadcasting broadcasting is that the
right word
streaming um from a new location so I
think the last live streams we all did
together were in sort
of late summer Early Autumn early fall
Bethal good morning B Diaz to you in
Spain um to uh in in August September
and I was
um what was I doing then I can&amp;#39;t
remember anyway anyway now I think this
is the for me this is the first live
stream let me just switch to uh the main
scene the first live stream from a new
location and that new location you can
sort of see here open image new tab
maybe uh you can sort of see that&amp;#39;s my
new location so I live on a narrow booat
uh on the English and Welsh canal system
and in fact I am right now the the thing
you can see behind me the window you can
see behind me is well it&amp;#39;s a pair of
Windows on this little duck so-called
duck hatch so that&amp;#39;s exactly where I&amp;#39;m
sitting at the moment there&amp;#39;s my
internet connection there&amp;#39;s my uh 4G 5G
Omni directional antenna so I&amp;#39;m coming
to you via that
antenna so there we go and inside so if
you if you were to open these catch
doors you would see this is where I&amp;#39;m
sitting right now you would
see um this is where I am so I&amp;#39;ve got
quite a nice space and so this is
literally where I&amp;#39;m sitting right now
I&amp;#39;ve got my Chromebook monitoring the
chat but also monitoring my uh
containers I&amp;#39;ve got my main screen I&amp;#39;ve
got my Elgato key light like camera and
everything so yeah there we go uh so
it&amp;#39;s great to see everybody it&amp;#39;s great
to see everybody sarup Krishna Phil good
day Phil to down
under this is amazing absolutely amazing
so um what are we going to do well let
me let me explain a little bit more
first we&amp;#39;ve got that&amp;#39;s us right now and
in 24 it&amp;#39;s going to be even more
exciting and uh I&amp;#39;m looking forward to
this as much as you
because we&amp;#39;re not only live streaming on
Fridays as usual but also thanks Lu and
thanks Phil uh but also in fact I&amp;#39;ll
share the um I&amp;#39;ll share my hacky profile
anyway I&amp;#39;ve got a little chat here
woohoo oh by the way um there we go
there&amp;#39;s the we&amp;#39;re going to be referring
to that URL there there is the thing
with the picture on it and also um
there&amp;#39;s
uh there&amp;#39;s the post on my blog uh where
you can see the picture of literally
where I&amp;#39;m sitting right now anyway
anyway anyway let close that close that
close that so Antonio is in the chat as
well I know you said hello before
Antonio but say hello again Ian good
morning Ian fellow Runner fantastic
perfect setup well you know it&amp;#39;s um I
you know what this um this these fairy
lights behind me of course i&amp;#39; got them
still from uh from from having them up
at Christmas but I put them across there
I was inspired by another live streamer
that I watch a lot which is Brett Fisher
uh in fact if I go to here Brett Fisher
there we go Docker and devops let me
share that as well he&amp;#39;s back he&amp;#39;s back
uh I I really love this uh this channel
Brett&amp;#39;s got a lot of stuff on Docker
devops cubetti swarm
everything hi Antonio there there we go
nice little Segway to CPU memory
Graphics yes yes good morning Antonio to
bomia in uh Portugal there we go uh so
yeah so we got
Antonio also live streaming next week on
what day is it it&amp;#39;s on uh wed Tuesday or
Wednesday it&amp;#39;s midweek isn&amp;#39;t it um so
there we go so let&amp;#39;s have a look live in
five days I think it&amp;#39;s Tuesday isn&amp;#39;t it
Antonio let us know Antonio when it is I
can&amp;#39;t work out which day in my head
right now so we got a lot of things
going coming so with the new design as
well Antonio&amp;#39;s done a live stream
already that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s number
two but that&amp;#39;s why ours for example
number one this is the first
episode of a new series Hussein good
good night to you in Istanbul welcome
welcome welcome himansu hello as
well uh so this is the first number one
episode of a new series where we&amp;#39;re
going back to basics so I
think I&amp;#39;ve had we&amp;#39;ve all the Advocates
have had feedback um from doing code
jams from tutorial participants from Dev
toober Fest at the live stream&amp;#39;s on
Wednesday thanks Antonio the Antonio&amp;#39;s
live stream is on Wednesday make sure
you go over here and subscribe to the
channel I&amp;#39;m on this is my know this is
the sap developers ID now but subscribe
to the channel and then hit
notifications and everything so you get
the notifications fcan good morning to
you as well and welcome so um
I&amp;#39;ve lost what I was gon to say now uh
oh yeah
so a lot of folks have asked for a sort
of a Back to Basics and more
fundamentals on cap okay we have done on
hands on SCB
Dev a number of sort of miniseries on
various aspects of cap sort of quite
Niche things like man in fact you can if
you want to look at those we have the
playlists here where are the playlists
here for example I&amp;#39;m hoping I can find
them straight away yeah so we did a we
did a live stream series on managed
associations um and we also did a live
stream series on service integration so
those are quite sort of focused but
really what we&amp;#39;re going to be doing in
this new series is just going back to
basics and starting from absolute
scratch um and dispelling any fears or
questions you may have so that&amp;#39;s the
other thing during this episode and all
future episodes and I&amp;#39;m sure Antonio
would say the same thing as well with
his live streams and all my other
developer Advocate colleagues who may or
may not be doing live streams in the
future in
2024 the whole point for you and for me
is that you can ask questions we can
interact in the chat because I&amp;#39;m
monitoring the chat down here you saw
that little Chromebook uh thing on my
desk I&amp;#39;ve got the chat there now so I
can see people saying hello and
everything so there&amp;#39;s no question too
silly to ask okay I might not be able to
answer it but we can work it out
together I it hello Amit and
welcome so um it&amp;#39;s all about cap sap
cloudification programming model and
what I thought we could do just today
this first episode is start really
really
simple and I wanted
to start with a setup it&amp;#39;s very warm
actually I put the fire on but it&amp;#39;s
quite warm now in fact open the window
maybe not um that door there there we go
that&amp;#39;s better
um so that&amp;#39;s the door to the bathroom by
the way so if you look in fact if you
look at the this is this is just
completely going off piece if you go to
my blog and look at this for this latest
blog post that&amp;#39;s where I am so right now
open imion new tab that&amp;#39;s where I am
there&amp;#39;s my desk and there&amp;#39;s a monitor
there and I&amp;#39;ve just opened that door to
the bathroom there we go anyway anyway
that&amp;#39;s just too much information
um if we can do this so that everybody
can follow along either live while we do
it and some of those folks who are crazy
or silly or brave enough to do that
would be amazing let me know but I want
to do this uh in a way that everybody
can play along
now the web page we&amp;#39;ve got up here
welcome to cap the cloud application
programming model this is known
colloquially internally as well I think
some people pronounce it Kayo I
pronounce it capaya which is sort of not
really authentic the idea is that it&amp;#39;s
uh play on the Italian word cap who is
any anybody from Italy here who can uh
who can correct my pronunciation but
capir is obviously to understand to to
Gro okay and the whole point of capire
is that it&amp;#39;s documentation that helps
you understand cap right
so and it&amp;#39;s a wonderful resource so
we&amp;#39;re going to be going through over the
next few
episodes the getting started okay partly
because you know I can&amp;#39;t think of
anything better because this is great
partly because I think these days I
think we sort of need certainly me I
speaking for myself but let me know in
the chat we
need sometimes a reason to go and stare
at the documentation and work through it
so we&amp;#39;re going going to be working
through this documentation together
because it&amp;#39;s
awesome the other thing though is that
hey poke poke geek or is it Pokey geek
is it as in Pokemon or poke as in Peak
and poke from the home computers of the
1980s let me know uh but hello
anyway um so the the point is that we&amp;#39;ve
got this getting started section and
we&amp;#39;ve jumped here getting started in a
nutshell from the big get started button
here however however however
however okay all this getting started
here
assumes that you&amp;#39;ve got the appropriate
tools and libraries and everything set
up RTM Antonio Antonio says RTM I think
You&amp;#39; missed out a letter there Antonio I
think that letter might be F and I think
we&amp;#39;re allowed to say rtfm maybe not
spell it out loud but yeah
rtfm you know what I capir so Lu L is
saying capir excellent um yeah so the
jump start guide which is this jump
start development the one before this is
like the description of what anybody
needs to do to set up for local
development and I&amp;#39;ll say up front as
well I said this in the uh we wrote this
in the description of this live stream
episode that we&amp;#39;re going to be focusing
on node.js there has been a question
about Java I&amp;#39;m not a Java person uh
maybe we can get somebody on to to S
cover some of the Java aspects because
it&amp;#39;s also awesome it&amp;#39;s Pokemon itself
poke geek excellent um there&amp;#39;s probably
only a few of us around here that old
enough to remember Peak and poke those
commands on the 8bit computers of the
1980s where you could read and write
memory locations
directly
anyway um so we&amp;#39;re going to be doing no.
JS now if you have a look at uh the
table of contents here if you want to
set up for local
development right which is what we&amp;#39;re
going to do because one of the beauties
of cap is that you can develop it in the
cloud for example using Sab business
application Studio or Dev space there or
a code space on GitHub or whatever right
um but quite often and and embracing the
beauty of this sort
of fast Dev turnaround you want to be be
able to develop locally on your own
machine however I was thinking
hm if you want to install for local
devel set up for local development any
of you out there including me on your
machine whether it&amp;#39;s a Windows a Linux a
Mac device you know whatever Chromebook
Chrome OS all these different things you
need to install node.js you need to
install the CDs DK we&amp;#39;ll talk about what
that is shortly you need to install
git
SQL light if you&amp;#39;re doing Java cap you
need to install Java Maven and you need
to install Visual Studio code vs code I
mean you can use any editor you
want vs code is what uh
cap um promotes because a it&amp;#39;s pretty a
pretty awesome
editor and it&amp;#39;s available for all
platforms and also of course the sap
business application Studio Dev spaces
are also based B on the
open-source components of vs code code
OSS I think it&amp;#39;s called okay so I think
when when was it Antonio I can&amp;#39;t
remember maybe two or three four months
ago they switched from Eclipse Thea as a
basis for the depth spaces in the
business publication Studio to code OSS
and it&amp;#39;s awesome and it allows for a
little bit of a better sharing of
extensions between actual vs code and
Dev spaces in the business application
Studio and also of
course GitHub code spaces are basically
also the same as Dev spaces in the
business application Studio or vice
versa so it makes sense to have a vs
code based set however however however
you know having spoke to many of you
during code jamps a lot of you have you
know laptop configurations that
maybe prevent you from installing these
sort of things and you don&amp;#39;t want to or
you not allowed to install
things so what I&amp;#39;ve decided and also
because I&amp;#39;m you know I&amp;#39;m obsessed with
everything in
containers what I want to do is go on
this little journey with you with the
minimum footprint possible on your
actual laptop so that you can do all
sorts of things without messing up your
laptop installing you things having to
maybe have admin rights and so on and so
forth
so all I&amp;#39;m going to require you to to
install if you want to follow along is
vs code and also a container engine now
this is not a
container Series so we&amp;#39;re not going to
get into the vagaries of you know Docker
desktop versus podman desktop versus lxc
all these different container
Technologies for the purposes of
learning
I use Docker desktop okay and for anyone
learning personally you know this is
free so it&amp;#39;s great now if you&amp;#39;re using
it for your corporate work for your for
the you know for your client sorry for
your client for your employer there may
be a contract in place with Docker to
use Docker desktop with a license
version brought from a personal learning
perspective you know that&amp;#39;s what I
use and it&amp;#39;s awesome I mean again like I
say you can install pod man deskt and
use the same sort of thing but I&amp;#39;m going
to be using Docker desktop so all you
need is Docker desktop vs code and
that&amp;#39;s it okay so with that in
mind let me show you what I&amp;#39;ve set up
for us so that we can start on this
journey helmet containers thumbs up
excellent Nico good morning Nico Nico
how come you haven&amp;#39;t got a um a spanner
next to your name uh you should we&amp;#39;ll
talk about that later you should have
admin access as your own personal IDE
anyway fan yes oh oh does anyone have
experience in build oh sorry I missed
that question does anyone have
experience in building a cap software as
a service without any DB just
projections on public apis yes and Nico
answers it&amp;#39;s literally as simple as not
using a DB yes I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a
beautifully uh flippant but well well
meaning uh reply but basically that&amp;#39;s
exactly what it is what Nico says so
effectively you know to to to run a cap
service you can either have you know
persist layer and that persistence layer
can be you know anything like you know
SQL light but there are you know there
are sort of things to think about when
you&amp;#39;re using SQL light which is
a a file based uh SQL storage system to
something like postest or something like
sap Hannah sap Hannah cloud and so on
you can also run a an inprocess in
memory SQL light database for sort of
you know ephemeral data if you&amp;#39;re just
doing sort of calculation SE and so on
or you don&amp;#39;t need any database at all
and the other thing is that you can
build a cap service that is effectively
a proxy so you integrate other services
we we do we&amp;#39;ve got a Cod jam on this
we&amp;#39;ve got a service integration with cap
that is all about bringing in the
definition of an API a public API in
this case an S4 hanter
API and then sort of wrapping that with
some uh new entity definitions some
schema definitions to sort of minimize
the the exposure that we want to control
of that public API in a new API sort of
putting a you know a veneer on it okay
there&amp;#39;s no database involved there right
so yeah absolutely uh super
straightforward with cap you&amp;#39;ll find
that one of the one of the beauties of
of cap is that what&amp;#39;s that phrase it
makes simple things easy things simple
and hard things possible something like
that pearl easy simple hard
possible is from oh yeah making the easy
things easy and the hard things possible
there we go inspired by uh the creator
of one of the most beautiful programming
languages in the world pearl of course
and that&amp;#39;s what that&amp;#39;s what cap is for
me as well okay um so here we go also
there&amp;#39;s brilliant discussion between
Nico and fulan I&amp;#39;ll let that continue
because what I want to show you is in uh
oh by the way by the way the sap devs
the latest developer news is out let me
share that oh yes let me share that URL
there across
here Bang there there&amp;#39;s the latest sap
developer news now let me go across to
this ridiculously small deliberately
small
starter okay it&amp;#39;s got read me which is
literally just that title so that&amp;#39;s
useless and then it&amp;#39;s got this directory
called
Dev container which is like a well-known
name and vs code will recognize that
when it starts up and says oh there&amp;#39;s
something in here that&amp;#39;s important in
terms of running within a container okay
so this will allow us to all read from
the same page and all do the things
together so all you need is vs code
installed I&amp;#39;ve got VSS code started up
here it&amp;#39;s completely blank slate I&amp;#39;ve
also got Docker running now one of the
uh things in here one of the files is
this Docker file
this Docker
file basically will give all of
us the facilities we need the tools that
we need that is described effectively on
this page on this page here so we will
have no JS which is in fact let me put
that side by
side there there we go we&amp;#39;ve
got there we go that&amp;#39;s better uh uh so
uh we have um the
nodejs image from Microsoft Microsoft
container registry it&amp;#39;s the node uh the
node 20 uh container image okay and uh
we also then install some tools it&amp;#39;s
basically based upon I think a
Debian a Debian distribution of Linux
now the other thing is the other
interesting thing is that um the
container you will have regardless of
your underlying operating system whether
it&amp;#39;s Mac OS or Windows or Chrome OS or
whatever the operating system that&amp;#39;s
running in your container or in your Dev
space in sap business application studio
is Linux because Linux is everywhere the
cloud is just made up of Linux machines
okay so the sooner you embrace the one
true operating system Unix Linux Etc um
that&amp;#39;s my personal opinion of course um
the better so we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re using a Debian
based operating system you don&amp;#39;t need to
know this by the way this is just giving
you the background because what I want
to do is leave no stone unturned in
terms of do this do that do the other I
want you to understand what we&amp;#39;re doing
by the way um let me know in the
comments whether this is interesting
useful whether it&amp;#39;s too much information
noded enough information um more
questions more questions more questions
rhl
oh is that Red Hat Linux Arif is that
Red Hat Linux is what you&amp;#39;re talking
about um yeah cool so we&amp;#39;re going to
install three tools curl of course you
know the command line HTTP client which
is awesome git so we can do some uh
source code control and SQL light three
because at some stage not today at some
stage we&amp;#39;re going to want to use SQL
light as a persistent store when we&amp;#39;re
developing our cap service okay by the
way does anybody anybody know why I&amp;#39;m
deliberately using the word cap service
instead of CAP app okay let me know in
the comments and let me know what you
think the difference is between a
service and an app from a from a
microservice perspective from a cloud
software or service perspective from a
cap perspective from a cap directory
perspective there&amp;#39;s a bit of a hint
there let me
know and then once we&amp;#39;ve installed curl
git and SQL lights through three which
is the command line tool because then
with SQL light 3 we can actually look
inside the SQL light database files and
say oh there&amp;#39;s a table oh there&amp;#39;s some
row rows in that
table then we&amp;#39;re going to set the user
to nodes because we don&amp;#39;t you know we
don&amp;#39;t want to run as root in the
container then we&amp;#39;re going to
install this thing here okay so for
those not familiar with what npm is and
what node is so node is effectively
JavaScript but it&amp;#39;s JavaScript on the
server side and it&amp;#39;s a little bit more
than that in terms of you know it&amp;#39;s a
it&amp;#39;s a a an asynchronous event based uh
engine and there&amp;#39;s a package manager
just like there is for many many other
languages generally uh so cpan is the
package manager or the package system
for Pearl and I can&amp;#39;t think of cargo is
the package management for rust you know
all that sort of thing um so npm node
package manager is the package manager
for node and the cap engine and tools
development tools are all
available as an npm package and they&amp;#39;re
all prefixed you can see this at sap
here at sap this is like a nam space
they&amp;#39;re all prefixed with at sap so
these are you know you can tell these
come from sap if we go to if we were to
go to npm I&amp;#39;ve got a little you know
Chrome search thing here uh sap fact at
sap CDs let&amp;#39;s do SAP CDs first of all
and not CDs DK there we go so we&amp;#39;ve got
there&amp;#39;s the node package node package
nice nice little playful thing here each
time you go there it&amp;#39;s got a little
different different meaning for mpm
nitrogen peroxide monoxide what it going
to say next refresh oh maybe it doesn&amp;#39;t
change I don&amp;#39;t know who knows um cap so
uh utash says cap services are
microservices an app is a service and
yes exactly I mean an app is a Services
an app is a Services an app what I in my
brain when I say service a cap service
I&amp;#39;m thinking headless I&amp;#39;m thinking a
service with no front end with no guey
with
no uii fiori view react angular whatever
web front end I&amp;#39;m just thinking of a
service in terms of for example a no
data service a headless service that
then other things can attach to and
consume okay and with
cap quite often folks use cap to build
headless services but also cap has the
facility to allow you to put together a
front end and Cat will also serve that
okay especially when you&amp;#39;re building and
uh in in this sort of tight Loop
development cycle locally and we&amp;#39;ll see
that with the different the three
different folders this there&amp;#39;s a
hierarchy the the
triumvirate of of uh folders of
directories app serve and DB so we&amp;#39;ll
come on to that
okay so here we go we can see sap CDs
and there&amp;#39;s also sap oh Rising there we
go hey hey Martin sap CDs and um Sab CDs
DK okay Sab Cloud application programing
model I to hit search sap CDs
DK there we go a direct hit now the
difference between sap CDs and sap cdsd
K notice here there&amp;#39;s sap sap Cloud
application programming model CDs for
node.js
think of this package as the package you
need the runtime package the
lean fat free cap runtime package okay
so when you deploy your application to
the
cloud your cap service is going to need
uh Lu yeah do I need to install
something do yes you need to yeah Docker
you need to install Docker
desktop and V s code and that&amp;#39;s it you
don&amp;#39;t need to install node npm git
anything else just dock a desktop and vs
code and that gives us the beauty of
abstracting everything so you&amp;#39;re not
messing up your own personal computer
your laptop whatever with stuff that you
don&amp;#39;t want otherwise okay so this is the
the lean fat free
runtime for when your servic is running
in the cloud but for when you&amp;#39;re
developing you want all of that lean
fat-free run time plus the extra fat and
the extra goodness and the beauty and
the
tools that allow you to develop in the
most efficient way
possible can anybody tell so a classic
for those who have been
developing with cap already there&amp;#39;s a
command that you run when you&amp;#39;re sort of
halfway through development and you sort
of you know you&amp;#39;re in this sort of flow
of making modifications and seeing those
ch changes in your service but you run
this this this CDs command CDs
something what is that command that you
run that command the one I&amp;#39;m thinking of
the one I&amp;#39;m hoping somebody will say
that
command is part of sap CDs DK is part of
the development kit because it makes no
sense to have that restarting command
this sort of development type Loop cycle
in the cloud when your appap is just
running headless service
so there&amp;#39;s the difference the CDs DK is
a development kit with CDs in it but
lots of other tools and then sap CDs
itself is just the sort of the the run
time version does that make sense I&amp;#39;ve
got a bit overboard there okay but what
we need to do because we&amp;#39;re going to be
developing we want to install the sap
CDs DK hasita welcome hasita one of the
uh many lovely people who uh partook and
was very vocal which is brilliant in the
uh developer challenge API in fact one
of the uh uh one of the superheroes
there fantastic CDs W exactly maybe
maybe we we need a command so that I
don&amp;#39;t know the more A&amp;#39;s you have in
watch you know the more things it looks
at to check whether things have changed
to restart I&amp;#39;m quite cool hey hello to
you in
bangalo once we&amp;#39;ve installed csdk that&amp;#39;s
it okay so this sets up a container with
everything you need with all this stuff
in it okay and also the beautiful thing
is you&amp;#39;ve also not only got the
container definition but you&amp;#39;ve also got
this sort of thing that tells vs code
that how to use this container okay so
Back to Basics sa cap Dev container it
tells you where the the docker file is
which is the file we&amp;#39;ve just looked at
but it also oh got horrible spacing
there sorry about that um it also tells
vs code what extensions to install now
if we go down here install Visual Studio
code from code.com it will also tell you
or recommend some extensions so one of
the reasons for using vs
code is because there&amp;#39;s a CDS language
support
extension that helps you at ton with
devel in cap services and cap
applications we&amp;#39;ll be using that and
looking at that so it&amp;#39;ll gives you it&amp;#39;ll
give you linting it&amp;#39;ll give you hints
it&amp;#39;ll give you formatting color coding
all that sort of stuff okay that&amp;#39;s
that&amp;#39;s that okay so that&amp;#39;s why that&amp;#39;s um
recommended es lint is a more General
sort of you know linter that will lint
JavaScript okay linting is basically you
know Finding issues and saying oh by the
way you should do this and don&amp;#39;t do that
and that&amp;#39;s wrong and bad practice etc
etc so ah yeah so Arif Arif is is he
hammering these uh these in here hoping
to get one of them that&amp;#39;s fantastic yes
AR a CDS watch CDs deploy as well I
think as arguably a development kit tool
as well uh so yeah so exactly so CDs
watch is what I was sort of aiming for
or thinking about because it&amp;#39;s a
developer it&amp;#39;s something you do as a
developer you know I want to watch this
thing I want you know and have the cap
server restart
automatically because I want to see my
the the effect of my changes as I&amp;#39;m
developing as fast as possible the
documentation the Capa documentation
talks a lot about this sort of tight
development Loop cycle thing uh which is
brilliant so it also installs uh it also
recommends es lint uh so AB I think dock
desktop is something new now as early it
was not part of ah okay so let me be
clear Docker and Docker desktop is not
part of a cap project this is my
recommendation my personal DJ
recommendation for you if you want to
play around with this you don&amp;#39;t have to
use Docker you can install all the tools
you can install all the tools as normal
as in uh where&amp;#39;s where&amp;#39;s the list here
node.js the npm package CD SDK you got
you can install git you can install SQL
lights and so on right and you may also
want to install other tools that help
you more generally with development like
the watch command or I don&amp;#39;t know can&amp;#39;t
think of anything off the top of my head
you don&amp;#39;t need dock a desktop for cap at
all it&amp;#39;s only if you want to tread as
lightest possible on your own
machine and also partake of this sort of
shared experience where we&amp;#39;re all
working in exactly the same environment
okay that&amp;#39;s all you could you can you
can develop a cap without Docker without
containers at all okay just let me be
let me be clear AET yeah do that does
that make
sense I&amp;#39;m
just conveying this as the simplest way
and the the the most light footed way of
starting so in here we can say in this
Dev container. Json I would like in my
container that we connect to from vs
code this this extension the Cs language
support the eslint extension if you go
for example to es lint here why what&amp;#39;s
what the heck is this name here D Bo
Boer vs code es lint that is
because there we go there&amp;#39;s es lint if
you have a look at the actual technical
name
that&amp;#39;s the name of the actual extension
so if we go to hum rest
client there if I put that there will
this work probably will do let&amp;#39;s have a
look Bang there there that is
also rest L there that&amp;#39;s the rest client
and so on and SQL like viewer okay fine
uh there&amp;#39;s the SQL like viewer and also
rainbow CSV to color code you know color
different Columns of CSV when we&amp;#39;re
looking at
CSV pathy exactly so pathy ask a
brilliant question is bass enough
instead of all these tools uh bass is
enough in that in fact yeah in that um
the business application Studio Let&amp;#39;s do
let&amp;#39;s go let&amp;#39;s go there let me go to my
trial account uh the business
application studio is available to all
folks having a trial
account okay ABG brilliant no problem at
all this is exactly what I I love and I
want you to do this all the time ABJ
asks a brilliant question
okay it wasn&amp;#39;t obvious to abjet or to
maybe other folks as well so ask the
question fantastic fantastic fantastic
fantastic okay instances and
subscriptions I can&amp;#39;t even say it um
I&amp;#39;ve got a subscription to the business
application studio in my trial account
you can get trial account as well for
free and um you you can get access to
the business application
studio so let me go in and answer that
question from parthy because I think is
really important so let me to create a
new depth space so I can say uh cap B2B
for example full stack Cloud application
right in fact let me make a full screen
you can see here that the full stack
Cloud application Dev space gives us all
these predefined tools and we can also
choose some additional extensions if we
were for example to want to develop uh a
cap service with an sap hand cloud back
end we might want to install some sap
hand tools we won&amp;#39;t do that now we also
have a code on that by the way we won&amp;#39;t
do that now we&amp;#39;ll just create a step
space in fact I should have pressed that
button before talking anymore because it
takes a few minutes to do that so why
let&amp;#39;s remind me uh let me don&amp;#39;t need
that let me delete that one anyway so
Pary remind me in a couple of seconds to
to come back
here and uh see if the dev space is
started but meanwhile we&amp;#39;ll go through
so that finally can anybody tell me and
again lots of people will know this
answer but that&amp;#39;s the whole point right
can anybody tell me what this is all
about forward ports
404 I&amp;#39;m going to wait for a second and
tell me in the chat what that means by
the way while I&amp;#39;m waiting I&amp;#39;ve got this
box out one of the very early Amazing
Friends of hands onb
Dev excuse me Mr Ronnie
sletter developed some amazing stickers
so we have the original handson Hands-On
ASB Dev stickers for your laptop so in
fact
um lots of folks uh have these and we&amp;#39;ve
also got some new stickers relatively
new stickers based upon can anybody tell
me what that computer is based
upon this amazing PC home computer
whatever with hands on SB Dev and it
says 10 learn 20 share 30 grow 40 go to
10 there&amp;#39;s a history behind that why
that says that so and also we also have
lots of these developers developers.
sep.com stickers so here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s the
thing oh I&amp;#39;ve also got some batches as
well look at
that slh hobble mode in AB up and uh
what&amp;#39;s this one eat sleep
code eat sleep code no repeat I don&amp;#39;t
know why it&amp;#39;s no repeat anyway eat sleep
code if anybody would like me to send
them through the
post some
stickers we I used to say send me a
direct message on Twitter I&amp;#39;m not on
Twitter anymore so instead
find me on LinkedIn and send me a direct
message on LinkedIn and then we can chat
and you can give me a a PO a postal
address to send the things too I&amp;#39;ll send
you a few stickers it might take a while
for me to get to the post office because
I&amp;#39;m obviously on a boat uh but I&amp;#39;ll send
them okay doesn&amp;#39;t matter where you are
in the world I&amp;#39;ll send them uh so let me
know okay so you&amp;#39;ll find me on LinkedIn
I&amp;#39;m sure uh so there we go Okay so we&amp;#39;ve
got some answers here uh K Steeler says
for the internal container port to the
external service perfect that&amp;#39;s a
beautiful
succinct uh and perfect answer from a
Docker container perspective so
obviously when something is listening
it&amp;#39;s bound to a socket and listening on
that Port Port 404 in this case inside
the container you can&amp;#39;t from your actual
PC my Mac OS machine here for example I
can&amp;#39;t connect to that socket I can&amp;#39;t go
there so this is saying expose that Port
404 to the host machine to my Mac OS
machine so I can in my web browser
Chrome go there okay and Arif says by
affording Port 404 you can access the
running application in your web browser
exactly right uh helmet you can find me
on Master on as well exactly send me a
private message on masteron if you want
as well in fact masteron there we go
that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s uh where&amp;#39;s me how do I go
to my profile ah there we go there
there&amp;#39;s my profile I&amp;#39;m Mastered on uh
there so uh yeah I&amp;#39;ve um that&amp;#39;s DJ by
the way me um I&amp;#39;ve moved away from
Twitter and I&amp;#39;m now master I encourage
you to join masteron and Helmont you can
tell people more more about your amazing
server on masteron if people want to
don&amp;#39;t know where to join and
everything so there we go uh we don&amp;#39;t
need that we don&amp;#39;t need that but the key
thing is the key thing is 404 is a very
cap specific Port okay it you know it&amp;#39;s
just a randomly selected Port by you
know caps bdfl benevolent dictator for
life it could be any you know any High
numbered Port but Daniel Cho Daniel hell
chose
404 Maybe next week I&amp;#39;ll tell you why he
chose 4,000 I think some people know I
think I&amp;#39;ve said this before but it&amp;#39;s a
very interesting non-technical reason
why he chose Port 4,000 or4 so for
example you
know uh you might have a local web
server listening up 8,000 doing things
you know whatever you know that what&amp;#39;s
the default Port of engin X I can&amp;#39;t
remember I seem to remember that um Ruby
on Rails I used to program with Ruby on
Rails and that default Port was like in
the three something series 3,000 anyway
doesn&amp;#39;t really matter but 404 when you
see 404 that&amp;#39;s sort of caps default
local Port okay
so let me get to the place where just
register I will let you in yes but hel
oh um I think did you try and put a URL
in there um I&amp;#39;m not
sure the UR didn&amp;#39;t didn&amp;#39;t appear so let
me put the URL in is it uh sapad on.org
there we go that&amp;#39;s sapad on.org I&amp;#39;ll put
it in there Bang there um maybe it
filtered out or something I don&amp;#39;t know
um so there sat on you can create an
account there so helmet is very kindly
running out for us
so this thing here if we now go here let
me close that close that oh it&amp;#39;s running
there we go so go back to pathy you
didn&amp;#39;t remind me come on Pary pay
attention just one more moment your
velopment is starting to open about to
open so what I can do what we can all do
here let me just do that here as well
what we can all do is go to cat B2B
again try not to use G git because we
don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t want to require to install
git we can say download zip okay and you
can download the zip file which should
download these
files download zip I&amp;#39;ve already
downloaded it
there and then I&amp;#39;ve also there it is
there
um Let me let me clean that out okay so
now I can say unzip let&amp;#39;s have what&amp;#39;s in
it first of all C you don&amp;#39;t need to use
a command line tool to do this you can
do it with a you know a normal you know
gooey zip thing if you really want to
but all it&amp;#39;s got is exactly the content
of what&amp;#39;s in that git repo so I&amp;#39;m going
to say unzip uh that and it&amp;#39;s going to
unzip it into a directory called CAP btb
dmain so if we have a look now CD cap
btb D main what we&amp;#39;ve got in there is
the read me but if we look at all of it
in fact Let me show let me show you in a
a normal thing because this is a Back to
Basics there we go scratch cat B2B main
we go in there and then I don&amp;#39;t know why
I can&amp;#39;t set this as a setting can I set
this as a setting um there we can show
the hidden files the ones beginning with
Dot and we&amp;#39;ve got those two files that
we looked at there then once you&amp;#39;ve
downloaded this ZIP file okay so you can
go to um where is it again uh go to not
there go to
there which is Cap
B2B uh where there cap B2B fatty hello
to you in Istanbul hello hello hello go
there and download it unpack it and
then start up vs code so in fact I&amp;#39;m
going to close vs code start up vs code
okay now one of the things you will need
in vs code
is the dev containers
extension let me um go there Dev
containers
there install the dev containers
extension so
that okay so that you have access
to this thing down here right it goes
like that if I click
that we have all these different
facilities to open remote resources but
all I&amp;#39;m going to do for
now is do the simplest thing that could
possibly work let&amp;#39;s get rid of this
extensions thing and say open folder
okay I use the word directory all the
time
vs code uses folder I think a lot of sap
literature uses folder as well as some
maybe a I don&amp;#39;t know a more windows I
thing I don&amp;#39;t know so directory folder
same thing okay open folder now I&amp;#39;m
going to
open that folder okay that directory cap
bb-
main now what does it say it says here
the folder can oh the folder contains a
Dev container configuration file reopen
folder to develop in a container
reopening container okay so what&amp;#39;s
happened is vs code has opened that
directory it&amp;#39;s seen the readme file but
it&amp;#39;s also seen this wellknown don&amp;#39;t need
that one this
well-known directory name called doev
container okay it&amp;#39;s actually it&amp;#39;s
actually now an open standard by the way
Dev sorry
containers containers dodev containers
dodev amazing a there&amp;#39;s so much stuff to
learn here um and what that&amp;#39;s done is
it&amp;#39;s Rec recognized oh there&amp;#39;s AEV
container directory here let me look in
there and let me offer the user DJ the
ability to restart or reopen that
directory so that you&amp;#39;re working inside
a container with that directory attached
okay so now because in the container
definition we look in Dev container
here I&amp;#39;ve got it to install curl git and
SQL light three let&amp;#39;s just try to
see
curl there it is
get there it is SQL light three there it
is so we&amp;#39;ve now got all the tools inside
the container now I don&amp;#39;t know whether I
I don&amp;#39;t know whether I&amp;#39;ve
got uh curl I&amp;#39;ve got Cur I&amp;#39;ve got curl
obviously I install curl everywhere git
I&amp;#39;ve got git here as well but you might
not have SQL light three I&amp;#39;ve got SQL
light three there as well okay fine but
that&amp;#39;s me you may not have any of those
things on your actual local machine
that&amp;#39;s the whole point of doing this in
a container so you don&amp;#39;t need to install
it on your local
machine what else have we got though
what else have we
got the most exciting
thing we&amp;#39;ve got the result of this thing
here we&amp;#39;ve actually we&amp;#39;ve even got node
let me go here right we&amp;#39;ve got node good
morning Javier and welcome old friend
from the live stream fantastic good
morning good morning good morning so
we&amp;#39;ve also got n node there we go we&amp;#39;ve
got node 20 just as
our definition our Docker file
definition
specified okay there&amp;#39;s that variant sort
of you know
substituted not only that mpm list
Global so I&amp;#39;ve said show me the packages
that are
installed
globally and look we&amp;#39;ve got CD SDK PN PM
I have no idea what that is maybe it&amp;#39;s
maybe it was installed because CD SDK
needed them I don&amp;#39;t
know but the key thing is we&amp;#39;ve got CDs
DK installed so we&amp;#39;ve got everything we
need now oh volume volume up please oh
right okay volume up I&amp;#39;ll move this
microphone here is anybody else maybe
maybe try your volume uh bis M as well
but people let me know if the volume is
no good people let me know if the the
the resolution is no good the old uh the
old friends of the channel will know
that I want you to tell me if anything
wrong if I can do anything better so I&amp;#39;m
going to move a bit closer to the
microphone let me know if that&amp;#39;s better
BM but also try and turn your volume up
too uh and see if that
helps oh my cof&amp;#39;s gone cold a drat
anyway so we got everything
now the moment of
truth pnpm is a monor rep thing for npm
thank you Nico see any Nico would know
uh volume is good thanks AP volume is
good loud and clear Daniel oh my
goodness
ah so no pressure
but this this is always this always
happens right so Daniel is one of the
many superheroes in the cap team it&amp;#39;s
like oh my God better not say anything
wrong I don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m do I don&amp;#39;t
know what I&amp;#39;m doing but the thing that&amp;#39;s
that&amp;#39;s better for us right if I don&amp;#39;t
know what I&amp;#39;m doing we can find out
together
so the drum roll somebody give me a drum
roll I&amp;#39;m not sure how you give me a drum
roll in the chat but the drum
roll thing is that in this
container ah yeah let let me do this
right here is my Mac OS machine right if
I say CDs command not found CDs CDs is
basically the command line tool that you
will use for developing your cap service
your cap app does everything it&amp;#39;s
amazing right we&amp;#39;re going to be
discovering all the things about cap
through the magic of the CDs command
line tool okay you&amp;#39;ll see it actually
here uh there we no uh if we go back to
um there go to get started we&amp;#39;re going
to be hopefully before I stop ra when I
stop rambling right we&amp;#39;re going to do
CDs init Bookshop okay 10 minutes right
got 10
minutes I haven&amp;#39;t got CDs on my local
Mac machine but I have got CDs yes da
on in vs C because I&amp;#39;m inside my
container oh thank you P padara padara
sorry padara thank you padara excellent
drum roll there so we now have the power
of cap and our
fingertips so we can now start also let
me know in the chat if you&amp;#39;re if you
already have done or you&amp;#39;re planning
either now or between now and next
Friday when we&amp;#39;re going to carry on with
this this okay this is going to be a
multi episode series and that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m
deliberately allowing myself to sort of
ramble a little bit and make sure we
cover all the ground as we&amp;#39;re moving
very
slowly because you know we this is like
almost not quite but an
open-ended series of episodes okay this
is for you and me to find out together
all about the basics of cap right
fantastic thank you AP as well
so let&amp;#39;s go to here so if we go to
capier again cap get started we don&amp;#39;t
need to go through jump start
development because that&amp;#39;s all about
setting up the tools which you&amp;#39;ve done
already and this also then also tells
you about jump starting in fact let&amp;#39;s do
this let&amp;#39;s do this because we want to
explore this this documentation page CDs
init
Bookshop
now let me make that one smaller maybe
and let me move I know my head&amp;#39;s over
there but that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s proba fine isn&amp;#39;t
it oh by the
way ready I&amp;#39;m going to move my head to
the bottom bottom
top you oh by the way uh again everybody
give Nico a round of applause in the
chat for these
awesome um scenes so I can for example
you know go to secret I know I&amp;#39;m not
going to type anything secret here I can
go for a
coffee I&amp;#39;m back I&amp;#39;m back amazing amazing
so thank you Nico for all that it&amp;#39;s
fantastic so CD c s init Bookshop but
before we do that let&amp;#39;s say CDs init
d-el okay help is your friend d-el and
this gives
us uh there we go let&amp;#39;s move that across
here it&amp;#39;s a bit too small isn&amp;#39;t it let&amp;#39;s
go back and make it a bit bigger and
just scroll scroll up and
down so what are we doing when with CDs
in it okay because CDs the CDs command
line tool does a lot of
things it for example will do a onetime
activity like initialize a project which
we&amp;#39;re doing here but it will also when
we give it the right command sub command
let&amp;#39;s call it it will also start up and
run an actual cap server okay I&amp;#39;m using
the word server instead of service here
oh I thought you giving yourself clap
but that&amp;#39;s a thank you isn&amp;#39;t it yeah
nice one Nico
um so here what we&amp;#39;re saying is CDS init
Bookshop initializes a new project in
the folder project okay so it&amp;#39;ll take
CDs in it Bookshop and it&amp;#39;ll create a
new folder I&amp;#39;m going to use I don&amp;#39;t like
using the word folder but I&amp;#39;ll use the
word folder because you know get with
the program DJ um in the in the folder
called whatever you say with the current
working directory as default if we don&amp;#39;t
do anything else that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s going
to do we&amp;#39;re going to play around with
these add features in a minute okay but
we can go from zero to superhero oh
L thank you for asking that question so
Lu is saying I&amp;#39;m a little bit confused
sorry you are running vs code inside of
dock desktop no what I&amp;#39;m doing but
that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s
easily what something somebody might
think I&amp;#39;m running vs code on my Mac
machine if I scroll through the you know
apps on my Mac OS I&amp;#39;m running VSS code
I&amp;#39;m running a terminal I&amp;#39;m running
Chrome I&amp;#39;m running stream lasts desktop
for this live stream I&amp;#39;m running slack
because of because slack um so I&amp;#39;m
running running vs code natively on my
Mac OS computer here there right but the
vs code itself is connected to a
container image okay if I go to here you
can see there&amp;#39;s a container called keen
banak and it&amp;#39;s got this vs vs code so
it&amp;#39;s basically I&amp;#39;ll show you here it&amp;#39;s
easier
Docker uh container LS oops Docker
container l s there so that&amp;#39;s this thing
here by the way this sort of nice
display of containers images volumes and
networks and everything that is called
lazy Docker so that is that that one let
me make it smaller so we can get it on
one line that&amp;#39;s lazy team lazy Docker
the other container that&amp;#39;s running is
the container that vs code started up
when it
saw the dodev container directory in the
folder in the directory opened and what
vs code did is create a new container
that&amp;#39;s the container it
created
there based upon which image the image
that was described in the dev container
Jason so that&amp;#39;s the contain that this is
the the docker file itself but the dev
container Jason says create a container
based on the information in that Docker
file okay does that make sense
perfect yeah I was I was I&amp;#39;ve got to say
I was wondering about whether this would
be a little bit of a bumpy start but
once we once we started in containers
then everything we can do we don&amp;#39;t you
know we don&amp;#39;t have any vagaries or
weirdness oh I can&amp;#39;t install this on my
machine or oh this is not working I got
the wrong version of node or whatever we
all have the same version of node we all
have the same version of mpm we all have
the same version of cap blah blah blah
blah all the same experience right and
it&amp;#39;s exactly the same oh yes here we go
uh where&amp;#39;s the where&amp;#39;s the um oh it&amp;#39;s
here isn&amp;#39;t it um there get started so
parthy was it pathy ask about this so
I&amp;#39;ve got a Dev space if I open up a
terminal um there we go user CDs there
we go we&amp;#39;ve also got CDs that it&amp;#39;s Cap&amp;#39;s
everywhere cap is everywhere so we&amp;#39;ve
got CDs there as well so if you want you
can do it in a Dev space on sap business
application you we&amp;#39;ve also got you know
because Dev because the dev spaces are
pretty cool you&amp;#39;ve got git already
you&amp;#39;ve got Cur so you&amp;#39;ve got also you
got all the tools there as well have we
got SQL light three yes you got SQL
light three as well so you could you
could do it like this instead in fact
before we uh before we close off that
idea if we go to here you could
also in GitHub open up a code space in
fact I just opened up a code space based
upon this repo redesigned potato what a
brilliant name so let&amp;#39;s just let that
run as well so you could do it in a
GitHub code space as well it&amp;#39;s all the
same right it&amp;#39;s a container so that is
no worries it got I&amp;#39;ll just close it
that is a container
where is it h this is a container look
it&amp;#39;s a code space and it looks like it
looks like a de space
in business application you do because
that&amp;#39;s exactly the same thing right it&amp;#39;s
okay so there we go so this is in on
GitHub so once we get terminal once it
starts up opening remote and everything
you know it&amp;#39;s all the same thing it&amp;#39;s
all in a container right so uh there we
go so we can do that so if we let&amp;#39;s do
that right so let&amp;#39;s close open screen uh
open close clear the screen so CDs init
Bookshop let&amp;#39;s do that and see what
happens right so one of the things I
want to do is read through all of the uh
log lines the output so we understand
everything adding feature no J so if we
CDs in it
help there add one or more features
while creating the project okay and by
default it will create because you know
because we&amp;#39;re sort of running in a no
context I guess but anyway it will it
will will
create or add this feature no. JS okay
so if you wanted to create a javab base
project you&amp;#39;d say CDs in its um Bookshop
do-- add Java okay and there&amp;#39;s all sorts
