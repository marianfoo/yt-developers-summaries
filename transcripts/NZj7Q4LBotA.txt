9m42s: thank you for reminding me sound uh URLs
9m44s: in the chat yes you are elsr in the chat
9m46s: thank you Angelo for letting me know uh
9m49s: Martin vavic sound now in uh not very
9m52s: far from here in Liverpool sound is a
9m54s: word that&amp;#39;s used to mean great sound
9m57s: that&amp;#39;s sound uh so I&amp;#39;m not not sure
9m59s: whether you&amp;#39;re saying in that way or
10m1s: what is just a word sound I don&amp;#39;t know
10m3s: so um let me know what you mean by sound
10m5s: um okay where where we left off last
10m9s: week um we would we&amp;#39;ve been doing a few
10m14s: um odate operations we did uh a query we
10m17s: did a read and we did we did a um create
10m21s: and we did a delete and all those sorts
10m24s: of things using this um test HTTP thing
10m27s: there I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve um updated did that and
10m29s: pushed that to the repo so if you have a
10m30s: look in the repo if you want to have a
10m32s: look um it&amp;#39;s all there so uh what&amp;#39;s it
10m34s: called CAP
10m35s: B2B there is it there yes oh hello test
10m39s: H been large isn&amp;#39;t it there we go so
10m41s: there uh Excellence so I&amp;#39;m not sure what
10m43s: sort of format this HTP is but anyway
10m45s: you can see there it is so it&amp;#39;s there um
10m49s: now Martin my bad oh oh anyone have
10m52s: sound uh I think the sound is okay um
10m56s: yeah so it might be it might be a
10m58s: problem you right I don&amp;#39;t know by the oh
11m1s: yes by the way rrick uh Rish uh should I
11m4s: say good morning to you in Frankfurt
11m8s: uh fact attemped to F I was going to say
11m11s: the reason my voice is is better than
11m12s: normal is because I went for a run this
11m14s: morning a little bit of a bonus quick
11m16s: run um and the weather was horrendous
11m18s: and all of a sudden I ran into a hail
11m20s: storm which was freezing and basically
11m23s: all the way through that Hailstone which
11m24s: was for about 5 minutes I was shouting
11m27s: cuz it was it was 5:30 in the morning I
11m29s: was shouting um on the on my run the f
11m33s: word CU it was really painful so I&amp;#39;ve
11m36s: been um I&amp;#39;ve been enunciating before
11m39s: this uh live stream anyway DJ stop
11m41s: talking nonsense and get on with
11m44s: it John muray last week mentioned guids
11m47s: and there was a really good conversation
11m48s: in the chat about guids so what I
11m50s: thought i&amp;#39; would do today
11m53s: is have a bit more of a look at
11m56s: guids okay so uh
11m59s: whereabouts did we encounter guids and
12m2s: what are guids because one of the things
12m4s: is that at the moment in our data um
12m10s: just for ease of use if we got the you
12m12s: know books here there we go just for
12m13s: ease of use we&amp;#39;ve got really simple IDs
12m17s: one two three and in fact I think what
12m19s: we did was we put um you know had a
12m21s: meaningful you know DJ Breaking All the
12m23s: Rules a meaningful sort of key uh where
12m27s: I see 101 you know if it&amp;#39;s 100 series I
12m29s: said it was you know always an author
12m31s: anyway that is not really scalable and
12m34s: you know we should
12m36s: embrace um better practices here uh
12m40s: there&amp;#39;s a link Daniel or somebody remind
12m42s: me to find that thing in cap in capir in
12m45s: capaya uh talks about uu IDs and and
12m48s: best practices there uh it&amp;#39;s really good
12m50s: so we&amp;#39;ll have a look at that in a minute
12m53s: but at the moment then what we&amp;#39;ve got is
12m56s: if I have a look at uh um not only the
13m0s: data the data that&amp;#39;s put it there put it
13m3s: there um Bookshop books oh my goodness
13m5s: me this is crazy is it Bookshop books
13m6s: and put down there so we&amp;#39;ve got a
13m9s: Bookshop service within the service
13m11s: directly defined and we&amp;#39;ll hopefully get
13m13s: to that as well directly defined we&amp;#39;ve
13m14s: got a books entity and a author&amp;#39;s entity
13m16s: and we&amp;#39;ve got we went back to the
13m19s: explicit key ID and we&amp;#39;re using integer
13m22s: and that&amp;#39;s why for example note that
13m24s: when we have a look at the actual um
13m26s: entity set Jason the Jason
13m29s: representation of the entity set we get
13m30s: one two and three or you know we get you
13m33s: know 10 101 102 103 and also if we have
13m37s: a look here we can you know do a OD data
13m39s: what is it a read operation 102 and
13m42s: there we go
13m44s: now what I think we should do is just
13m49s: briefly Embrace let&amp;#39;s have a look at the
13m51s: let&amp;#39;s have a look at the um cap capire
13m55s: let&amp;#39;s the documentation uh so we can
13m56s: find it uh CU ID let&amp;#39;s go from from the
14m0s: aspect that we&amp;#39;ve already played about
14m2s: cui you know documentation is fantastic
14m5s: um so we&amp;#39;ve got aspect cuid which we
14m7s: know about learn more about canonical
14m9s: keys and
14m11s: uuids so does anybody know what a uid is
14m14s: in fact does anybody know because it&amp;#39;s a
14m17s: standard what RFC you know like so for
14m21s: example who knows about r as in uh and I
14m24s: don&amp;#39;t this is an
14m26s: sap live stream so of of course we&amp;#39;re
14m29s: all thinking oh remote function call
14m30s: function modules function pools ab app
14m34s: forever uh but I don&amp;#39;t mean remote
14m36s: function calls um I I mean um request
14m42s: for comments it&amp;#39;s one of the
14m44s: standard documentation Styles templates
14m48s: formats for
14m51s: encoding encoding as in for writing down
14m54s: officially uh standards for example of
14m58s: the the top of my
15m0s: head because it&amp;#39;s one of my
15m3s: favorites um the atom publishing
15m7s: protocol which is you know which is upon
15m10s: which the uh odata standard is
15m12s: originally based is RSC
15m15s: 5023 but maybe more more well known RSC
15m19s: 2616 who knows what RSC 2616 is oh there
15m23s: we go it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s there it&amp;#39;s in my history
15m25s: even um because I refer to it quite a
15m28s: lot
15m29s: um in fact oh I must have referred to it
15m30s: last week when
15m32s: um uh when we uh when we did that OD
15m37s: data create operation we got a 2011
15m39s: created and and in fact uh the newly
15m42s: created resource can be referenced by
15m44s: the UI returned in the entity with the
15m45s: most specific URI found in by the
15m47s: location head of field anyway RFC 2616
15m49s: RFC one of my favorite sort of meta ones
15m52s: is RFC oh DJ stop digressing but RFC to
15m57s: not too anyway no let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s not even
15m58s: go there so RFC 4122 I think it&amp;#39;s 4122
16m3s: there we go 4122 a universally unique
16m6s: identifier Ur name space that&amp;#39;s a bit of
16m10s: a mouthful for a Friday morning however
16m13s: oh yock says as well exactly right y
16m16s: Universal unique identifier uu ID and
16m19s: basically this is an incredibly
16m21s: interesting um RFC that describes what
16m25s: uu ID is and sort of how to generate
16m27s: them as well and it&amp;#39;s got an example
16m28s: somewhere um there we go the following
16m31s: is an example of the string
16m32s: representation of a string
16m33s: representation of a universally unique
16m35s: identify as a UR uh we leave that sort
16m38s: of prefix out so that&amp;#39;s what a uuid
16m41s: generally looks like 128 bits um so
16m44s: we&amp;#39;ve got like this you know
16m46s: uh was it four bytes uh two bytes two
16m49s: bytes two bytes what&amp;#39;s that one two
16m52s: three four five six by one two three
16m55s: four five I can&amp;#39;t count eight maybe I
16m57s: don&amp;#39;t know um
16m59s: so that&amp;#39;s a uu ID and if we have a look
17m2s: here we can see that in fact we looked
17m5s: here didn&amp;#39;t we we looked here we looked
17m6s: here we looked here CU ID go and have a
17m8s: look in there and uu ID U sorry the CU
17m13s: ID is
17m14s: defined as an ID element let&amp;#39;s use the
17m17s: right word I think I I&amp;#39;ve been using the
17m19s: word
17m20s: property but I think element is a better
17m22s: a better word to use Daniel or anybody
17m25s: let me know what you use to refer refer
17m28s: to
17m30s: things inside of entity definitions I
17m33s: use properties sometimes sometimes I use
17m35s: fields which is sort of more at the
17m37s: persistence layer but I think I think
17m40s: official cap
17m42s: nomenclature it&amp;#39;s a big word for Friday
17m44s: morning as well is
17m47s: element anyway so the cuid aspect is
17m51s: defined as a single a singular element
17m54s: marked as being key and also being
17m56s: defined of the Type U ID U ID is one of
17m59s: the built-in types in CDs attribute
18m1s: interesting Mark attribute that&amp;#39;s good
18m3s: as well oh there goes a um a goose can
18m6s: you hear that
18m7s: then flying past um so uid is a standard
18m13s: sort of builtin canonical keys and uuids
18m16s: there we go so uh prefer uids for keys
18m21s: I&amp;#39;m not going to read all this but in
18m23s: fact let me just put that in the chat
18m25s: because that&amp;#39;s super important go back
18m27s: and read that later
18m29s: don&amp;#39;t interpret U IDs all sorts of
18m31s: things um all sorts of things here CDs
18m33s: comes with a small set of buil-in types
18m34s: U ID Boolean blah blah blah blah blah so
18m37s: why don&amp;#39;t we switch back here to what we
18m43s: had before which was to use the
18m45s: cuid let me put my face down the bottom
18m48s: cuid um uh aspect uh
18m53s: cuid and do that there as well and then
18m56s: we can get rid of that and that let&amp;#39;s
18m58s: save that now one of the interesting
19m3s: things is
19m4s: that the U type which incidentally as we
19m9s: I think we did see didn&amp;#39;t we maps on
19m13s: to a standard you know so the entity
19m16s: data model part of the OD data standard
19m19s: also recognizes this thing this type and
19m24s: it calls it a guid u ID Cu uh guid same
19m27s: thing right
19m29s: um it recognizes it so have a good
19m32s: morning question is it possible to
19m34s: deploy data models in SQL likeing cloud
19m35s: found sub accounts just for PC yes it is
19m38s: yes it is it&amp;#39;s not a good idea for
19m41s: production of course um but yes
19m44s: absolutely and people do that in fact I
19m46s: think um for
19m48s: the developer Challenge on apis last
19m52s: August I created a service and I had
19m57s: some sort of static data that I wanted
19m59s: to have for that being to be served for
20m1s: that service and I stuck it in a SQL
20m2s: database and you know I didn&amp;#39;t need it
20m4s: to scale this thing so it&amp;#39;s just sitting
20m6s: there because of course you know um it&amp;#39;s
20m9s: a very good question but but of course a
20m11s: SQL like database maybe we should do
20m12s: that next actually a SQL like
20m15s: database not Cloud Foundry but secq is a
20m18s: file okay so it&amp;#39;s a file sitting in a
20m21s: cloud foundary deployment right and so
20m25s: if you scale out what&amp;#39;s going to happen
20m27s: to that you know this is why backing
20m29s: services I don&amp;#39;t know where that phrase
20m31s: came from this is why backing services
20m33s: like postgress service or sap hand the
20m35s: cloud with hdii container they&amp;#39;re more
20m38s: appropriate for production because of
20m40s: course you know there&amp;#39;s a separation of
20m41s: concerns and you don&amp;#39;t have to worry
20m43s: about the fact that if you destroy a a
20m45s: pod a container kubernetes or you know a
20m48s: cloud Foundry
20m49s: um I can&amp;#39;t think of the word a cloud
20m52s: Foundry build pack based deployment and
20m55s: recreate it or scale it out you know if
20m57s: you you got your data in a file is no
21m0s: good right so what people do in EG me uh
21m4s: Daniel says I I would say I would
21m6s: usually say element what a very polite
21m8s: way of saying that Daniel yes I yeah so
21m10s: I&amp;#39;m trying to use the word element so
21m12s: remind me in a minute jaier or somebody
21m15s: why don&amp;#39;t we also have a look at um
21m18s: deploying because at the moment we&amp;#39;re
21m20s: using in memory aren&amp;#39;t we uh so let&amp;#39;s
21m22s: remind me to have a look at SQL light we
21m24s: will cover that today um by the way I&amp;#39;m
21m27s: away now next week uh so they won&amp;#39;t be
21m29s: one next week so let&amp;#39;s give you a chance
21m30s: to catch up with everything uh jaier
21m32s: yeah it&amp;#39;s file but required a SQL like
21m34s: to be installed on the Diego Diego cell
21m36s: yes oh yes in the where the cap services
21m38s: on yes um exactly exactly so what was I
21m42s: doing I can&amp;#39;t remember oh yes so we&amp;#39;ve
21m44s: just removed the explicit integer based
21m48s: integer typed key ID and we&amp;#39;re going
21m50s: back to the Cy which is basically best
21m52s: practice as we you&amp;#39;ll see in that
21m53s: documentation from cap when you read it
21m56s: however there are some subtleties that
21m59s: we need to be aware of of which we need
22m1s: to be aware of course you know we can
22m4s: still get uh you know make a o data
22m6s: create U query operation but look now
22m10s: the actual sort of you know core in fact
22m12s: where is it the I&amp;#39;m sure I saw it
22m14s: somewhere um see list of built-in types
22m17s: look at that U uu ID an opaque opaque
22m20s: string let put in the chat what you uh
22m24s: what you understand by or why there&amp;#39;s a
22m27s: remark here and opaque string what is
22m29s: that
22m30s: implying what does that tell us as
22m32s: developers right put in the chat what
22m34s: you think that
22m35s: is here&amp;#39;s an example an example value
22m38s: and look it&amp;#39;s got single quotes around
22m41s: it so basically it&amp;#39;s a it says it&amp;#39;s a
22m43s: string there basically it&amp;#39;s a string and
22m46s: it&amp;#39;s stored in an nvar
22m48s: 36 now also then look suddenly the
22m53s: values that came from here are now
22m58s: strings but
23m1s: also and I&amp;#39;m showing you this because I
23m3s: hit this thing and I was thinking what
23m4s: is going on my brain wasn&amp;#39;t working and
23m6s: this is what David uh last week
23m10s: helped me out on and you know DJ DJ you
23m13s: idiot it&amp;#39;s this no he didn&amp;#39;t say that in
23m15s: my brain I said
23m17s: that now if we were to go and try and
23m24s: specify a key to do an OA we
23m29s: operation we get something weird right
23m32s: and
23m34s: that&amp;#39;s we haven&amp;#39;t got time to dig into
23m36s: exactly why but I wanted to show you
23m40s: this basically if you&amp;#39;re going to define
23m43s: the
23m44s: key or the property in general the
23m47s: element in general to be of type uid and
23m50s: we are doing you know implicitly by
23m52s: using the CID aspect then the actual
23m55s: values do need to be
23m58s: uu IDs so let&amp;#39;s put one in or
24m5s: uh oh no what we&amp;#39;ll do what we&amp;#39;ll
24m8s: do is first of all we&amp;#39;ll refresh that
24m13s: and then we&amp;#39;ll go and we&amp;#39;ll use this
24m14s: testing we use this testing so here we
24m16s: go we did that service name I&amp;#39;ve tided
24m19s: this up a bit so we got the first
24m20s: service name books and I&amp;#39;ve got the
24m21s: proper sort of names here I think Daniel
24m23s: quite rightly pointed out that I had
24m25s: some stupid names for my actual requests
24m27s: here so I&amp;#39;ve cleaned up queer books
24m29s: again oh um good morning to CER opaque
24m33s: oh thank you yes for uh for uh answering
24m35s: the question I asked opaque
24m37s: noninterpretable exactly the string
24m39s: should not be passed for embedded
24m40s: information or meaning I couldn&amp;#39;t have
24m42s: said it better myself fantastic yes so
24m45s: basically treat it as some data that is
24m49s: atomic as it were don&amp;#39;t try to work out
24m51s: things based upon the actual structure
24m54s: of the U ID or even the values in it
24m56s: exactly uh oh and Y also says it has no
24m59s: inherent meaning or structure that can
25m0s: be interpreted by the system or
25m1s: application processing
25m3s: excellent 100 points for all of you
25m5s: fantastic right so uh if we do a send
25m8s: request what&amp;#39;s going to happen we&amp;#39;ve got
25m10s: this thing here and we&amp;#39;re not specifying
25m13s: oh got stock here what&amp;#39;s the stock doing
25m15s: let&amp;#39;s get rid of that for now um let&amp;#39;s
25m17s: save that
25m18s: um uh let&amp;#39;s send this request let&amp;#39;s see
25m21s: what happens good morning to you
25m23s: Lawrence in the Netherlands welcome old
25m25s: friend Ro hands on as if de welcome so
25m27s: send request it&amp;#39;s going to happen there
25m30s: we go
25m32s: now what&amp;#39;s happened and what did and
25m35s: didn&amp;#39;t didn&amp;#39;t I do I didn&amp;#39;t
25m39s: specify a value for remember um let&amp;#39;s
25m43s: just go uh oh we&amp;#39;ll go here you know I&amp;#39;m
25m46s: also in that same directory in my
25m48s: terminal so if I say CDs compile to SQL
25m52s: the services CDs um we see that I I
25m56s: should have put
25m58s: not only a title but an ID okay so all I
26m2s: specified though was a title so and I
26m4s: think it says somewhere here uh will
26m9s: autogenerate uh I can&amp;#39;t think um
26m14s: somewhere in here it will tell you that
26m18s: you can basically
26m20s: have a uid based typed
26m24s: field DJ stop saying field element and
26m28s: in O create operations for example it
26m30s: will be generated for you if so I can do
26m32s: another one let&amp;#39;s do another one here we
26m34s: go um let&amp;#39;s run run run run run send
26m36s: request send request send request bang
26m38s: look at look at these things change here
26m39s: look at those things change bang bang
26m42s: bang bang we&amp;#39;re generating U IDs each
26m44s: time shout out hey mlan sorry mlan
26m49s: mallix Luciano shout out
26m52s: um shout out I did ask you to remind me
26m56s: of something I can&amp;#39;t remember what it
26m57s: was which is why I asked you to remind
26m58s: me was that a shout out to remind me of
27m0s: something tell me what it was to do oh
27m4s: there some sort of um aquatic bird
27m6s: behind me I can hear it
27m9s: going um so now oh yes SQL squel yes so
27m15s: now if we have a look
27m18s: here check it out we
27m22s: get new entities in our entity set
27m26s: because we&amp;#39;ve been creating them but
27m28s: also these entities are in fact let&amp;#39;s do
27m32s: one where it&amp;#39;s got a different um
27m33s: different name um bananas bananas so
27m37s: let&amp;#39;s do one there and send that so we
27m38s: can see
27m40s: it uh oh there we go bananas right so
27m42s: let&amp;#39;s go for that one so let&amp;#39;s get that
27m45s: and now we
27m48s: can let&amp;#39;s see let&amp;#39;s see what happens if
27m50s: we do that we can do that remember
27m53s: remember
27m55s: remember this is like the new sort of OD
27m58s: dat trendy trendy what am I talking
28m0s: about DJ V4 sort of you know single key
28m3s: style OD data read operation but we can
28m5s: also I think do that right oh no we
28m9s: can&amp;#39;t ah no we can&amp;#39;t we have to we have
28m10s: to do it um slightly differently um but
28m13s: anyway what was
28m15s: it I can&amp;#39;t remember which way around to
28m18s: do
28m19s: it let&amp;#39;s go um oh yes um ID equals oops
28m26s: we can do that even
28m28s: I
28m29s: think no uh books I oh that&amp;#39;s not the
28m34s: right segment is it is it there dedm
28m38s: value count for key ID equals that oh
28m41s: books ID ah I know I know I know I know
28m44s: what I&amp;#39;m
28m45s: done no okay anyway let&amp;#39;s get not let&amp;#39;s
28m48s: not get sidetracked if somebody can
28m50s: figure out what I&amp;#39;m doing wrong here my
28m51s: brain&amp;#39;s like going a million miles an
28m53s: hour and zero miles an hour at the same
28m56s: time well key thing is you need to
29m0s: specify you can do like let&amp;#39;s go back to
29m2s: what we had which was that in order to
29m5s: be able to specify like that you the
29m7s: values need to be U IDs now by the way
29m11s: by the way by the way this came up in um
29m13s: the conversation I had with um books one
29m15s: two yes that&amp;#39;s it exactly uh books that
29m18s: that works uh Veron
29m21s: if um it&amp;#39;s a if it&amp;#39;s not a uui but if we
29m25s: because if we do that oops without the
29m28s: single quote so if we do varon&amp;#39;s uh
29m31s: there we go ah of
29m34s: course I was I was just still thinking
29m37s: of the uh the single quotes fantastic uh
29m40s: go goo yeah equals look at look at all
29m44s: these different things here let&amp;#39;s all
29m45s: try all the different things oh my
29m46s: goodness me so we&amp;#39;ve got that one and
29m48s: we&amp;#39;ve got um that one let&amp;#39;s just do that
29m53s: GID is that what you&amp;#39;re saying
29m56s: here
30m0s: I&amp;#39;m not sure oh is it not on equals but
30m3s: is it I can&amp;#39;t remember um so yeah if we
30m7s: were to do that I
30m10s: think H come on TJ what are you
30m15s: doing yes there we go oh we&amp;#39;ve done that
30m17s: already yeah uh without the single
30m18s: quotes fantastic fantastic okay
30m23s: anyway see I told you I don&amp;#39;t know what
30m25s: I&amp;#39;m doing um
30m29s: now so that&amp;#39;s that so that&amp;#39;s that a bit
30m32s: of a digression one of the things that
30m34s: um I said oh you know when I was having
30m36s: a chat with uh darid it&amp;#39;s like you know
30m39s: oh generating U IDs this is how I do it
30m41s: you know for example node uh require
30m45s: there&amp;#39;s a
30m46s: crypto Library built in and that has a
30m49s: random U
30m52s: ID um
30m54s: function okay so you can do that
30m58s: so what you could do for example is say
31m2s: um uh node
31m7s: node by the way while I&amp;#39;m typing this
31m10s: somebody put in the chat what this
31m13s: triple less down sign thing is it&amp;#39;s a
31m17s: bash
31m18s: ISM let me know what you think it is
31m21s: uh
31m24s: console.log require uh we need to escape
31m28s: these dou quotes
31m30s: cryp to escape quote Oh you random you
31m37s: ID oh require crypto
31m41s: uh conso oh no I don&amp;#39;t need that do I
31m45s: here we go don&amp;#39;t need to escape those
31m48s: there we go so let&amp;#39;s do that
31m51s: again so I thought ah I can generate uu
31m53s: IDs like that and then I can say you
31m55s: know Alias put that in an alias or in in
31m57s: a script but then also notice that that
32m0s: will put a new line right console log
32m2s: will always do a new line so when I when
32m6s: I&amp;#39;m in the in the terminal which is
32m7s: mostly you know that&amp;#39;s nice I want that
32m9s: but when I&amp;#39;m in an editor that wants to
32m10s: sort of call out to a a bit of code to
32m13s: insert something I don&amp;#39;t want a new line
32m15s: and if we say instead
32m18s: um uh in fact let me show you let me
32m20s: show you I don&amp;#39;t want to
32m22s: digress uh too much U ID I put I did
32m25s: this last night if B basically if it&amp;#39;s a
32m28s: terminal if the context of the this node
32m30s: execution is a terminal then just use
32m33s: console log otherwise use process.st
32m36s: standard out. write because that doesn&amp;#39;t
32m39s: put a new line so I can say here
32m43s: um if I say that uh uu ID I&amp;#39;m in a
32m47s: terminal uu ID I&amp;#39;m in a terminal if I
32m51s: say uid word count length uh zero
32m54s: because there&amp;#39;s no l sorry word count l
32m57s: L there&amp;#39;s no lines if I say
32m59s: um uh that there we go for example see
33m4s: there&amp;#39;s not there&amp;#39;s a non- useless use
33m5s: of cat DJ pull yourself out of this
33m9s: digression and get back into the program
33m11s: but basically you can do that so that
33m13s: for example we can go into here and say
33m15s: data
33m17s: bookshops uh what is it authors CSV if I
33m22s: say that and then say um o NOP waway uh
33m30s: change
33m31s: word uh control R equals system U ID I
33m38s: could put something in there right and
33m40s: that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what I love about um uh
33m44s: Vim because I can anyway anyway DJ
33m46s: digressing in fact let&amp;#39;s do another one
33m48s: right uh let&amp;#39;s do a
33m52s: um system mu ID there now now if we load
33m57s: it up and restart
34m1s: here the
34m5s: authors should all I a bit big should
34m8s: also have uu IDs okay anyway what time
34m12s: is it 8:33 I can&amp;#39;t believe it right oh
34m16s: Manish is saying hi Von excellent
34m18s: friends on the chat uh brilliant
34m21s: now one of the things is that if I go
34m24s: now oh CU I restarted it didn&amp;#39;t I I
34m26s: killed it just with contrl + C and I
34m29s: restarted it so how many books you think
34m30s: we&amp;#39;re going to
34m31s: have we&amp;#39;re back to square one all those
34m35s: books I
34m37s: inserted uh man it&amp;#39;s okay to say hello
34m39s: to people it&amp;#39;s great uh all the books I
34m41s: inserted in this test. htps are gone why
34m46s: is that tell me why that
34m49s: is what are we doing here the simplest
34m52s: thing that could possibly work but what
34m53s: are we doing here which causes let me do
34m55s: that one again look I&amp;#39;m going to send a
34m56s: request to to um create a book with
34m59s: bananas send a request refresh there it
35m2s: is but now if I contrl + C stop the cap
35m5s: server and start it up again go here and
35m9s: refresh that entry is gone and all we&amp;#39;ve
35m13s: got are the
35m16s: three bits of data that were in the CSV
35m19s: file that were loaded automatically in
35m22s: it from databook shop.
35m24s: books tell me what you think
35m28s: local testing yes speos this is for
35m29s: local testing but also sometimes local
35m32s: testing I might want to persist some
35m35s: data right um and what is happening what
35m38s: is going on for me you know grow as you
35m42s: go convention over configuration that is
35m46s: causing me to have my data that I will
35m49s: you know create with OD data create
35m51s: operations to disappear when I restart
35m53s: the cap
35m54s: server put it in the chat I&amp;#39;m yeah I
35m57s: think sometimes I go too fast and then I
35m58s: get the digressions so I&amp;#39;m going just
36m0s: calm down for a second and put in the
36m2s: chat what you
36m4s: think is happening here and in fact we
36m7s: can see it on the screen
36m9s: here let me know shout out in the
36m14s: chat meanwhile meanwhile while you shout
36m17s: that
36m18s: out let me move that down
36m21s: here close that close that close that I
36m25s: want to go back to in oh chanaka
36m28s: fantastic thank you chanaka yes in
36m30s: memory
36m31s: database right which is great you know I
36m34s: mean look successfully deploy to
36m36s: inmemory
36m38s: database uh and CA says because it was
36m41s: saved in SQL like inmemory nonp
36m42s: persisted database yes and Kim says
36m45s: memory and data CSV file yes that&amp;#39;s
36m47s: where the data is coming from data CSV
36m49s: files clears after every restart y
36m51s: janaka now if we wanted to have a little
36m54s: bit more of a persistency
36m57s: for our testing this is still in test
36m59s: mode of
37m1s: course we have the ability to say I want
37m4s: to put this in an actual SQL like
37m8s: database which goes back to the
37m9s: conversation we had earlier talking
37m11s: about who asked the question was it
37m12s: Havier asked the question about um using
37m15s: SQL light databases as in you know DB
37m18s: files for example in Cloud Foundry so
37m21s: let&amp;#39;s have a look at that because we&amp;#39;re
37m23s: going to need that once we start playing
37m25s: around a little bit more
37m27s: if we search here let&amp;#39;s use the cap
37m29s: search what&amp;#39;s going on let&amp;#39;s use cap
37m31s: search with uh K and um cql
37m36s: light um SQL light for using SQL light
37m41s: just I love the I love the uh
37m42s: documentation brilant using SQL
37m44s: development deployment persistent
37m46s: databases look at that now you can also
37m50s: use P just put that there in the chat
37m53s: just put in the chat there you can also
37m56s: use assistent SQL like databases follow
37m58s: these steps to do so specify database
38m0s: name database file name in your DB now
38m2s: for those of you who have used cap um
38m6s: you know before a while
38m9s: ago when you
38m13s: did a CDS deploy which I remember
38m17s: remember remember the 5th of November um
38m20s: CDs have all have all has all these
38m22s: commands and we&amp;#39;ve used some of these
38m23s: commands one of the commands we haven&amp;#39;t
38m25s: used yet is um CDs deploy oh Kim says
38m31s: can this connect to sap business one as
38m34s: well and is it using server layer um cap
38m39s: can connect to anything that&amp;#39;s got an
38m42s: API that&amp;#39;s got some sort of HTP
38m44s: interface or that&amp;#39;s got some sort of you
38m46s: know event style inter you know rabit mq
38m51s: or um mqtt or you know all these
38m55s: different event protocols cap can speak
38m58s: as well so no I&amp;#39;m not a business one
39m2s: person I think I reviewed a business one
39m4s: book once which I&amp;#39;ll learn a little bit
39m6s: from um but I don&amp;#39;t know and I don&amp;#39;t
39m8s: know what you mean by especially as one
39m10s: word is that a specific thing server
39m12s: layer so if you can explain a little bit
39m14s: more to me to my small brain what that
39m16s: is um and what you&amp;#39;re referring to as it
39m19s: is it using server layer uh I&amp;#39;m not sure
39m23s: what you mean there so please explain a
39m25s: bit more and why do that um we&amp;#39;ve got
39m29s: CDs deploy deployed to databases or
39m33s: Cloud okay CDs deploy d-el if you have a
39m38s: look
39m39s: here somewhere I was having a look
39m41s: through this and
39m43s: somewhere there&amp;#39;s this no save option
39m46s: which we don&amp;#39;t need anymore because
39m48s: before when you did a CDS deploy uh to
39m52s: SQL light for example it would
39m54s: automatically and nicely put in for you
39m58s: what it thought you probably wanted for
40m0s: a require section in your package or in
40m3s: your CDs environment okay but notice
40m6s: that it&amp;#39;s deprecated the package Json
40m8s: file is no longer modified now there&amp;#39;s
40m10s: different reasons I can imagine for that
40m12s: most of which revolve around the fact
40m15s: that it might not know exactly what you
40m17s: want to do so rather than guess it
40m19s: doesn&amp;#39;t but also I like the
40m23s: approach of um BAS basically being able
40m27s: to specify from the scratch what you
40m29s: want so you know what you what you&amp;#39;re
40m30s: doing okay so uh Matias I am a business
40m34s: one person too mat Matias
40m37s: welcome Matias how is your uh sticker I
40m40s: just I always think of your huge laptop
40m42s: with all those stickers on it and um the
40m44s: fact that you come to about a million a
40m46s: million Cod jams it&amp;#39;s amazing so uh
40m48s: respect to you Matas so Kim says Service
40m50s: L is s business one exposing an OD API
40m52s: oh okay well I mean if if sap business
40m56s: one exposes o data then you know it&amp;#39;s
40m59s: easy for um cap to consume that
41m2s: stuff service layer is the new way of
41m5s: building Integrations against business
41m6s: one instead of the old
41m8s: SDK uh yeah don&amp;#39;t we all love the old
41m10s: sdks who who here used to program with
41m13s: the RFC SDK some of the first webbased
41m16s: systems that had an sap backend I built
41m19s: from scratch with in C using the RFC
41m22s: SDK oh my goodness that was uh those
41m25s: were hey days
41m26s: Stone Age um anyway so why don&amp;#39;t we do
41m30s: this let&amp;#39;s do this let&amp;#39;s put that in
41m32s: here and let&amp;#39;s go back to here and let&amp;#39;s
41m35s: open up package Json
41m39s: right you&amp;#39;ll
41m42s: notice you&amp;#39;ll notice
41m45s: that I love the way that I think it&amp;#39;s
41m48s: really cool I love the way that you know
41m50s: when you move away from the copy code
41m52s: let&amp;#39;s get rid of that thing when you
41m53s: move away from the sort of the the code
41m55s: thing here
41m56s: all the bits that are not specifically
41m58s: relevant the context gets blurred out
42m0s: and yet focus on what we&amp;#39;re talking
42m2s: about but you get the context as well
42m5s: just
42m5s: like
42m9s: beautiful so I&amp;#39;ve copied all of this CDs
42m12s: requires now
42m14s: CDs remember the CDs EnV um let&amp;#39;s do
42m18s: this thing
42m20s: here CDs EnV look at that CDs n
42m25s: get
42m27s: requires I mean there&amp;#39;s millions of
42m29s: things right there look C this n get
42m31s: requires middlewares or in fact we could
42m34s: see here CDs and get
42m38s: requires JQ Keys what are the keys what
42m40s: are the top level things in that Json
42m42s: out but all DB and middlewares right so
42m46s: we can see there&amp;#39;s all sorts of
42m47s: different things in fact
42m49s: look implicitly oh my goodness me
42m53s: requires. DB we&amp;#39;re discovering things to
42m56s: together ourselves oh so um it&amp;#39;s
42m58s: basically uh Microsoft SQL Ms mssql
43m3s: based that&amp;#39;s
43m4s: cool we&amp;#39;re learning things all the time
43m7s: and we&amp;#39;re learning things together here
43m9s: because I&amp;#39;d not noticed this CU my
43m11s: brain&amp;#39;s too small but implicitly we
43m14s: haven&amp;#39;t
43m15s: specified this anywhere so out of the
43m19s: box there is a sqlite type of
43m23s: persistence database layer
43m27s: the credential where what is the URL
43m29s: this is like a special you know special
43m33s: uh value that says do it in memory and
43m37s: it&amp;#39;s implemented by the package cap JS
43m40s: SQL light me check out as well mpm
43m43s: search mpm for that it&amp;#39;s come on
43m47s: internet what it&amp;#39;s there CDs database
43m50s: service for SQL light look at that let&amp;#39;s
43m51s: share that as well
43m53s: bang okay so we don&amp;#39;t need that anymore
43m56s: um what we&amp;#39;ve got already is that but
44m0s: now what we&amp;#39;re going to do is replace
44m2s: not replace but
44m4s: augment the environment with this thing
44m7s: here let&amp;#39;s copy this and bring it in to
44m10s: our package Json so let&amp;#39;s get rid of
44m13s: that and paste that it&amp;#39;s going to
44m17s: be we don&amp;#39;t need that sort of outermost
44m20s: layer of things there CDs and we also
44m22s: need a comma right and also let&amp;#39;s format
44m24s: it uh format
44m28s: documents uh Kim SL service layer runs
44m31s: on both Hannah and mssql awesome awesome
44m34s: so what have I done I&amp;#39;ve added a new top
44m41s: level key top level property to our
44m45s: package Jason because it&amp;#39;s a very common
44m47s: and sensible place to put core
44m50s: configuration that&amp;#39;s specific to your
44m53s: cap server requirements okay you can put
44m55s: put in cdss rc. json. cssrc Json you can
44m59s: put them in the N environment you
45m1s: remember this sort of effective
45m2s: environment is a gathering up and
45m4s: mashing together of all these values in
45m7s: all these different
45m9s: places so now what does this what does
45m11s: this do this
45m14s: says we have a requirement for a DB of
45m17s: kind SQL light but the credentials the
45m20s: URL remember remember the thing was a
45m22s: plane going there&amp;#39;s lots of noise
45m23s: outside today there&amp;#39;s a plane going
45m25s: overhead now
45m28s: amazing CDs is it still there get
45m31s: requires DB so we&amp;#39;ve got credentials URL
45m35s: DB SQL light because now I&amp;#39;ve overridden
45m39s: that
45m41s: thing so if we now do a CDS
45m44s: deploy what do you think is going to
45m48s: happen CDs deploy now oh yes yes uh what
45m52s: we&amp;#39;ll also do keep an eye there they are
45m56s: coming to get me they&amp;#39;re coming to take
45m57s: me away cuz I&amp;#39;m just talking nonsense um
45m59s: they&amp;#39;re coming to get me speos help um
46m2s: uh CDs
46m3s: deploy keep your eye on this file list
46m7s: here let&amp;#39;s see what
46m11s: happens check it out
46m14s: db. SQL light db. SQL light so basically
46m20s: what&amp;#39;s
46m21s: happened is that remember when we had
46m23s: that error last was it last week and we
46m25s: Dig Dug into
46m26s: error and the error occurred when we&amp;#39;d
46m28s: remove the ID from the definition of the
46m31s: entity then we try to start up with CDs
46m33s: watch and of course it automatically
46m35s: tries to load anything it finds in CSV
46m37s: files in certain places into and it said
46m39s: oh I can&amp;#39;t find I&amp;#39;ve got this thing in
46m42s: CSV it&amp;#39;s got an ID field and there&amp;#39;s
46m44s: nothing corresponding in the persist in
46m47s: memory right that was actually in in the
46m50s: deploy phase wasn&amp;#39;t it remember and
46m52s: we&amp;#39;re doing a deploy here
46m54s: right so
46m57s: now we&amp;#39;ve now got a db. SQL light I&amp;#39;ve
47m1s: got SQL light in here yes I I think in
47m3s: my yeah in my Dev container
47m5s: definition in the docker file no in I
47m9s: think I think Christian&amp;#39;s pull
47m12s: request oh I&amp;#39;ve still got the old one
47m14s: here in Christian&amp;#39;s pull request um he&amp;#39;s
47m17s: changed it to a features thing for me
47m19s: but basically in here look I&amp;#39;ve got
47m22s: install of the SQL
47m24s: light um what&amp;#39;s the word client so we
47m27s: could say SQL light um db. SQL light and
47m33s: that will allow us to have a look
47m35s: inside the database do tables check it
47m39s: out oh my goodness me check it out okay
47m42s: um so let&amp;#39;s remove that um that&amp;#39;s an old
47m47s: database SQL light oh well it doesn&amp;#39;t
47m51s: matter
47m53s: um so anyway uh
47m57s: oh missed that um Antonio says ha I was
48m0s: wondering about the plane excellent we
48m2s: can include SBO service layer via CSN
48m4s: but the positions of the documents are
48m5s: only accessible via array in S4 Hannah
48m6s: the positions are exposed via separate o
48m8s: data point this is fascinating um don&amp;#39;t
48m12s: uh don&amp;#39;t apologize Matias this is
48m14s: amazing seel light the only day base you
48m16s: will ever need in most cases great thank
48m19s: you for sharing that I&amp;#39;m going to read
48m20s: that
48m22s: later as you can see in my uh SQL light
48m25s: can we do this like table I&amp;#39;m not sure
48m27s: you can do that oh there we go look at
48m28s: that you can put the command as the
48m29s: second parameter uh you can see I&amp;#39;ve
48m31s: been messing about here with other
48m35s: things um so I&amp;#39;m not sure DB did I
48m38s: already have a DV SQL light tell you
48m41s: what we&amp;#39;ll do tell you what we&amp;#39;ll do
48m42s: we&amp;#39;ll remove db. SQL
48m44s: light and we&amp;#39;ll also put
48m47s: [Music]
48m49s: um uh what should we call it hands on
48m51s: Sab Dev oh no we&amp;#39;ll call it
48m54s: Bookshop and then we&amp;#39;ll say CDs
49m1s: deploy uh
49m3s: Bookshop there we go that&amp;#39;s better so
49m6s: ignore the stuff I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t
49m7s: know where that DB that it suddenly
49m8s: reappeared
49m10s: again you have a bit of a premonition as
49m13s: to what what I want to play around with
49m15s: you next right or generally next so we
49m18s: have here um tables and in fact let&amp;#39;s
49m21s: come to here TQ light tables um select
49m24s: star from book
49m26s: Shop books semicolon there we go so we
49m30s: can play around with SQL
49m32s: light but the more important thing is if
49m36s: now we do CDs
49m42s: watch what&amp;#39;s missing and what&amp;#39;s
49m45s: there I&amp;#39;m going to take I&amp;#39;m going
49m47s: because yeah I think this is this is
49m49s: really
49m50s: interesting when we compare this to the
49m53s: output and this is why and also those
49m55s: who who
49m56s: have um been subject to subjected to my
50m0s: ramblings in code jams on cap will know
50m5s: will remember like a nightmare bad
50m9s: dream I emphasize that it&amp;#39;s super
50m12s: important to become friends with the
50m15s: output of the cap server because it
50m18s: tells you so much and then the
50m21s: difference between what happened before
50m23s: and what&amp;#39;s Happening Now what&amp;#39;s being
50m24s: output now tells us things as well so
50m26s: what can you see
50m28s: here that&amp;#39;s different and what can you
50m32s: not see
50m35s: here that we used to
50m37s: see y says in memory is missing exactly
50m41s: and also remember that deploy things
50m43s: loading data from booksh shops. CSV and
50m46s: loading books. CSV and loading data from
50m48s: authors. CSV that&amp;#39;s not happening either
50m52s: because remember does anybody know why
50m54s: be let&amp;#39;s can open up a split terminal
50m57s: here um split terminal bash the one true
51m2s: shell um if we do a
51m6s: CDS watch d-el let&amp;#39;s just retrace our
51m9s: steps let&amp;#39;s put that up here as well
51m11s: right oh no let&amp;#39;s leave that there so we
51m13s: can see it here right
51m17s: help no init from exactly kaston says no
51m20s: in it from CSV perfect we&amp;#39;re not getting
51m23s: that and why are we&amp;#39;re not getting that
51m25s: well we&amp;#39;re doing a CDS watch so let&amp;#39;s
51m27s: have a look at the help for CDs watch oh
51m29s: CDs watch is just a convenient shortcut
51m31s: for CDs serve all D- with MOX D-
51m34s: inmemory question mark and remember CDs
51m37s: serve help right CDs serve help is
51m41s: what&amp;#39;s happening here let&amp;#39;s make that
51m42s: one small it&amp;#39;s all nice and neat in
51m45s: memory check it out that question mark
51m47s: there which is an optional thing
51m49s: automatically adds a transient inmemory
51m52s: database that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve all been
51m53s: talking about here and you&amp;#39;ve been
51m54s: saying in the chat as you know us the
51m55s: reason why the the data that we add sort
51m59s: of via HTTP after we start the server
52m1s: the reason that data disappears when we
52m3s: restart the survey is because it&amp;#39;s a
52m4s: transient in memory database right which
52m7s: is bootstrapped on each
52m10s: restart adds a question
52m14s: mark to apply a more defensive
52m19s: variant which respects the configured
52m22s: database here in fact why
52m27s: why don&amp;#39;t we
52m28s: try um what was it the shortcut for CDs
52m31s: serve um CDs serve help CDs watch help
52m35s: let&amp;#39;s do it let&amp;#39;s just run that look at
52m37s: that but without that let&amp;#39;s not put the
52m39s: question mark let&amp;#39;s see what happens I
52m41s: have no idea what
52m42s: happens but why is that a uppercase
52m46s: why CD CDs serve all Das with mock in
52m54s: memory
52m57s: let&amp;#39;s move that across here a bit what
52m59s: do you think is going to happen I&amp;#39;m
53m3s: curious now check it
53m7s: out this is amazing where&amp;#39;s that your
53m9s: memory thing there we go let&amp;#39;s put that
53m10s: there and put my head up here a bit main
53m14s: top by the way I keep I don&amp;#39;t know you
53m17s: can see or not I keep pressing there&amp;#39;s
53m19s: my little stream deck and press the
53m21s: different
53m22s: scenes now what has happened happened
53m25s: what has
53m27s: happened we didn&amp;#39;t use the question mark
53m30s: on the
53m31s: end
53m33s: there so the question mark applies a
53m36s: more defensive variant of this thing
53m40s: which does respect any database if it
53m44s: happens to be configured and only an in
53m47s: memory database if no persistent one is
53m49s: configured right but the what we the
53m53s: variant of this in memory option that
53m55s: we&amp;#39;re
54m0s: using is this
54m2s: one so it&amp;#39;s saying you want an inmemory
54m5s: database I&amp;#39;ll give you an inmemory
54m7s: database okay so we&amp;#39;re back to where we
54m10s: were connect DB SQL light URL memory
54m14s: ignores this thing here because we&amp;#39;ve
54m16s: said I want it in memory does the normal
54m19s: init from data blah blah blah
54m21s: successfully deploys this to IM memory
54m23s: database because of course you know it
54m24s: need you know I&amp;#39;ve covered that already
54m27s: and then says go right now but if we do
54m30s: this again and say question mark only do
54m34s: it to in memory if there&amp;#39;s not
54m38s: already a configured
54m42s: database
54m43s: bang look at what a difference a
54m46s: question mark makes
54m49s: right so
54m53s: now we&amp;#39;ve got Bookshop SQL
54m55s: light there&amp;#39;s no deployment here cuz you
54m58s: know it doesn&amp;#39;t need to deploy anything
55m1s: because database is not new you know the
55m4s: the new database that needs to be
55m5s: deployed into is this inmemory database
55m7s: but we&amp;#39;re not having an inmemory
55m8s: database here so there there&amp;#39;s no
55m10s: explicit deploy in the logs here so now
55m13s: let&amp;#39;s go back to um this thing here we
55m16s: get the three values as normal
55m19s: okay actually what I
55m22s: yeah what I should do really starts me
55m25s: to go on and put um put U IDs in
55m29s: shouldn&amp;#39;t I let me just go back here um
55m32s: uh data bookshops I&amp;#39;ve got I&amp;#39;ve got uu
55m35s: IDs there so let&amp;#39;s edit that and um yeah
55m39s: let&amp;#39;s get rid of those and say uh system
55m44s: sorry um system U ID in fact what I&amp;#39;ll
55m49s: do is uh I&amp;#39;ll record a thing here so
55m55s: insert uh system U ID
56m2s: there and stop recording now I can say
56m5s: at you and at you look at that the power
56m9s: of Vim what what other the editor ID do
56m12s: you need right so let&amp;#39;s do that but also
56m14s: of course now we have to redeploy don&amp;#39;t
56m18s: we so let&amp;#39;s get rid of that get rid of
56m19s: that get rid of that um get rid of that
56m22s: let&amp;#39;s just blast that away just in case
56m24s: bookshops SQL light CDs
56m28s: deploy and C uh SQL light Bookshop do um
56m34s: there select star from what&amp;#39;s it called
56m37s: bookshops do books Bookshop books there
56m39s: okay fine now CDs
56m43s: watch in memory question mark defensive
56m46s: variant I never know why that you know
56m48s: if I do a control D to exit
56m50s: the exit 130 I don&amp;#39;t
56m53s: know so now we have things with proper U
56m58s: IDs okay that&amp;#39;ll do oh by the way oh my
57m0s: goodness it&amp;#39;s almost time but I just
57m3s: want to show you this because it&amp;#39;s so
57m3s: cool right it&amp;#39;s so cool you can generate
57m6s: the U IDs you know we&amp;#39;re using this
57m8s: crypto library in nodejs random uid
57m11s: however when we start to think about
57m14s: application logic which we&amp;#39;re going to
57m15s: be right using the CDs libraries check
57m17s: this out and this is just a little
57m19s: Glimpse there&amp;#39;s a repple there&amp;#39;s a
57m21s: reppel command tell me what you think
57m25s: in oh yeah Vim oh yeah Vim tell me what
57m28s: you think or what reppel means what it
57m31s: stands for It&amp;#39;s actually an
57m34s: acronym
57m36s: cds. ms. uid check it out I mean how
57m41s: beautiful is that he could I mean we
57m43s: could do a whole series on the CDs
57m45s: reppel and you know the the the fact in
57m50s: fact Ka Kaa uh K uh no k k cds. utils is
57m58s: it there there we go look at that oh
57m59s: first one look at that this is all
58m2s: within CDs definite no where is it where
58m5s: are we I don&amp;#39;t know uh anyway yeah there
58m8s: it is common utility functions let&amp;#39;s put
58m10s: that in the chat as
58m12s: well can anybody tell
58m14s: me can anybody tell me don&amp;#39;t need that
58m17s: either um where are we can anybody tell
58m19s: me I can&amp;#39;t even think the question what
58m21s: the question was what what was I asking
58m27s: I can&amp;#39;t remember anyway
58m31s: anyway now if we go and bring back the
58m35s: test
58m37s: htps let&amp;#39;s have yeah that&amp;#39;ll do bananas
58m39s: that&amp;#39;ll do fine let&amp;#39;s just run that send
58m42s: request and now and notice
58m46s: here by the way
58m49s: that the cap server does the right thing
58m51s: gives us a 2011 created it gives us
58m54s: remember we looked in the the RFC 2616
58m56s: earlier in this episode and we saw the
58m58s: 2011 created requesting it basically
59m0s: says you know it&amp;#39;s good to put in the
59m3s: location header of the response the
59m4s: actual URL in fact there&amp;#39;s the clue as
59m7s: to how to get to that thing look check
59m9s: it out books it&amp;#39;s relative obviously
