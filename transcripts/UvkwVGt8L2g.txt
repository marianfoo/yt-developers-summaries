12m5s: this afternoon amazing uh that&amp;#39;s amazing
12m7s: so yeah say hi to Nico from o please

12m19s: right now so I can add links to there um
12m22s: what&amp;#39;s that I don&amp;#39;t need that anymore so
12m25s: let&amp;#39;s go let&amp;#39;s go so last week we ended
12m28s: on a Salam
12m29s: Mustafa Salam uh Salam
12m33s: um and welcome to you as well so uh we
12m38s: left last week on a like a oh my
12m40s: goodness what is that what is going on
12m41s: type thing when we were looking at
12m45s: something related to this composition
12m47s: targets are Auto exposed in service
12m49s: interfaces it was quite rushed at the
12m50s: end because I wanted to get it in just
12m52s: to put into brains so let&amp;#39;s have a look
12m55s: at what this is all about right so this
12m57s: is where we left off this is you know
12m59s: the co let me just um what did I do
13m1s: there uh let&amp;#39;s undo
13m4s: that what did I do I can&amp;#39;t remember what
13m6s: I changed any I&amp;#39;ll just undo it discard
13m8s: changes there we go fine
13m12s: so what we did was we had a look behind
13m16s: the curtain at what is generated from a
13m21s: core schema notation the sort of machine
13m23s: readable version of the CDs model we see
13m25s: in front of us in as in the combination
13m28s: of this CDs file which is where we got a
13m29s: service defined pulling in uh or making
13m33s: projections on the entities that are
13m36s: defined in our schema. CDs okay so this
13m39s: all comes together and we did we did as
13m42s: as Daniel pointed out before we did use
13m45s: the preview feature preview as yaml
13m49s: let&amp;#39;s get I don&amp;#39;t need that anymore uh
13m51s: and we saw that and what we did see as
13m53s: well is the fact that our Bookshop order
13m57s: items
13m59s: because we&amp;#39;re uh we&amp;#39;re projecting not
14m4s: projecting because the order items is
14m6s: the target of a
14m8s: composition right let&amp;#39;s just read the
14m10s: text again composition targets that&amp;#39;s
14m14s: keyword Target right
14m16s: here are Auto exposed we go Auto exposed
14m21s: so that&amp;#39;s why in the actual machine
14m25s: readable version of what we are defining
14m27s: in our sort of overall CDs model there
14m30s: we get this CDs Auto exposed true now in
14m33s: order to get this to to um go back to
14m35s: Visa I it Visa&amp;#39;s comment hello mass in
14m38s: to you in Sri Lanka and welcome welcome
14m41s: everybody amaz it&amp;#39;s just so amazing to
14m43s: see you all in the chat and I love the
14m44s: way that you say hello in the chat and
14m45s: tell me where you&amp;#39;re from and everything
14m46s: and what you&amp;#39;re doing got a glass of
14m47s: wine got a coffee whatever really cool
14m50s: so instead of doing this let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s
14m55s: figure out or let&amp;#39;s just do it manually
14m58s: as well because we can right so in fact
15m0s: in fact in fact in fact yeah we&amp;#39;ll do it
15m3s: in here we&amp;#39;ll do it in here CDs
15m5s: compile uh d-el okay oh tell you what
15m10s: that&amp;#39;s quite flat there so what I&amp;#39;ll do
15m12s: is I&amp;#39;ll bring in that over there and
15m17s: there we go hands onb
15m19s: Dev let&amp;#39;s make that a bit smaller put my
15m21s: head at the bottom right so let&amp;#39;s go
15m24s: into cap
15m26s: B2B there so we can now say CDs comp
15m29s: pile d-el let&amp;#39;s have a look at the help
15m32s: first of
15m33s: all uh make that a bit bigger there for
15m36s: now and there we go I&amp;#39;m just trying to
15m38s: sort of get the right level of
15m39s: information there now CS compile
15m42s: compiles a specific models of CSN format
15m45s: and what we can see here is that we have
15m48s: t different Target formats okay so
15m51s: currently uh it will support Json and
15m53s: yaml versions of CSN season if you want
15m56s: to look at what it was going to look
15m57s: like from a no data perspective that&amp;#39;s
15m59s: what this um entity data model type
16m1s: thing is all about if you want to look
16m3s: at how it will sort of um appear at the
16m6s: persistance layer in terms of ddl data
16m8s: definition language you know different
16m9s: flavors for Hannah and for sort of other
16m12s: SQL uh flavors then that&amp;#39;s what that&amp;#39;s
16m14s: for etc etc
16m16s: etc so what we can do is we say CDs
16m20s: compile --2 yamel okay that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the
16m25s: what&amp;#39;s going on behind the scenes in
16m26s: this Auto preview in vs code and what do
16m30s: we want to compile well let&amp;#39;s just press
16m31s: enter right it&amp;#39;ll say You must specify
16m33s: model to compile so what do we want to
16m35s: compile we want to compile uh well we
16m37s: compile let&amp;#39;s compile just the schema DB
16m41s: schema. CDs right when we get um let&amp;#39;s
16m45s: just see if we can actually uh language
16m47s: yaml let&amp;#39;s use bat to maybe um what&amp;#39;s
16m50s: the word color highlight it yeah there
16m52s: we go uh also we want the plane we don&amp;#39;t
16m54s: want the line numbers or anything like
16m55s: that uh plane there we go fine so
16m59s: uh bat is basically um cat with wings in
17m2s: fact that&amp;#39;s exactly what it is bat cat
17m4s: with wings um B There we go a cat clone
17m8s: with wings cat is just you know
17m10s: concatenated everything so there we go
17m12s: oh let&amp;#39;s add that to the let&amp;#39;s add that
17m13s: to the thing there uh bat there perfect
17m18s: and I&amp;#39;ll save that in a minute okay so
17m21s: we can see here where is it we don&amp;#39;t
17m23s: have any CDs Auto exposed that we saw
17m27s: here why because we&amp;#39;re only at at the
17m29s: moment here compiling the schema. CDs
17m32s: just the entity definitions there&amp;#39;s
17m33s: nothing else in there it&amp;#39;s inside a
17m35s: namespace that&amp;#39;s where we got this org.
17m36s: Q macro prefix but that&amp;#39;s it so what
17m40s: happens if we compile main. CDs which
17m42s: sort of pulls in Imports using that that
17m46s: stuff and then um oh actually we should
17m49s: do hold on we should get a uh what&amp;#39;s
17m51s: going on here let say a orders orgue
17m53s: about order items um yeah because
17m56s: because we&amp;#39;re not at the stage where
17m58s: we&amp;#39;re exposing things so we&amp;#39;re going to
18m0s: be exposing things when we Define a
18m3s: service so if we now say here um serve
18m8s: main.
18m9s: CDs we get a little bit more look you
18m11s: can see let&amp;#39;s do that again sorry
18m14s: CDs
18m16s: uh what do I I don&amp;#39;t want a page let&amp;#39;s
18m19s: do that again there
18m22s: uh what&amp;#39;s going
18m25s: on what what let&amp;#39;s just get rid of
18m30s: that there we go okay we&amp;#39;ll look at it
18m32s: in non-color for now I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s
18m33s: going on with the paging um but here we
18m36s: see the CDs Auto exposed right so that&amp;#39;s
18m39s: where this information comes from or
18m41s: rather that&amp;#39;s how you can generate and
18m43s: have a look at the yaml flavor of CSN or
18m46s: the uh Json flavor of CSN if I do that
18m48s: and do Json instead do um uh Jason um in
18m54s: fact that&amp;#39;s the default anyway right so
18m56s: if we say just CDs compile um
18m59s: get rid of that there and we just get
19m2s: the Json right there we go uh Antonio
19m5s: what app are you using for terminal I
19m6s: thought you used warp but it&amp;#39;s not no I
19m8s: don&amp;#39;t use warp I don&amp;#39;t really like warp
19m10s: it&amp;#39;s too too modern too complicated for
19m12s: me um and it means I have to take my
19m15s: hands off the keyboard and put them on
19m17s: the mouse uh more often than I want
19m19s: which is never um so now this is I&amp;#39;m
19m22s: using iter and I&amp;#39;m using t-o uh is my PD
19m27s: I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll see if I can remember to put a
19m28s: link Link in the in the thing to do with
19m30s: my terminal setup but basically it&amp;#39;s
19m32s: just t-mo and you know that&amp;#39;s it and
19m34s: Bash there we go there&amp;#39;s t-mo you know I
19m36s: can do pains and everything y perfect so
19m38s: anyway so that is where we get let&amp;#39;s
19m41s: just do that to to yaml again and um
19m46s: let&amp;#39;s put it into a file actually let&amp;#39;s
19m47s: put in main. yaml uh vain. yaml there we
19m55s: go so we can see that there we go look
19m57s: there we go order items Auto
19m59s: exposed right 819 Auto exposed is true
20m2s: and that means basically let&amp;#39;s put that
20m5s: back there again that means basically
20m7s: that let&amp;#39;s put that there and put that
20m9s: in there um that we can say if we start
20m11s: up the server cap CDs watch we
20m16s: can
20m19s: 404 observe two things okay come on
20m22s: there we go
20m24s: 404 local those
20m27s: 404
20m29s: B we observe we observe two things the
20m32s: first thing we observe is that order
20m34s: items is not there because we&amp;#39;ve also
20m36s: not exposed it there right so we don&amp;#39;t
20m39s: see it there either however just because
20m42s: we&amp;#39;ve not defined or exposed the order
20m45s: items entity in the service definition
20m48s: we still get
20m49s: it here in the metadata because in order
20m52s: to fulfill this composition
20m56s: relationship the the the the servic has
20m59s: got to know about it from a from an edmx
21m1s: perspective that&amp;#39;s so that&amp;#39;s why we can
21m2s: see the order items because it is a
21m5s: target
21m7s: of this navigation property okay so
21m10s: that&amp;#39;s part of what the auto expose is
21m12s: is doing and that also means that
21m15s: bookshops if we go to um Bookshop uh
21m18s: orders we can see the orders but it also
21m24s: means we can also follow that navigation
21m27s: property to go and ask for the items
21m30s: right so oh thank you Carson thank you
21m32s: foring item t-m I did used to use Kitty
21m35s: Kitt is pretty cool as well as a
21m36s: terminal uh emulator but you know items
21m39s: okay as well it&amp;#39;s
21m40s: fine uh so there we go but what we can&amp;#39;t
21m42s: do what what we can&amp;#39;t do and what the
21m45s: automatic Auto exposing of targets of
21m49s: compositions will give you is we can&amp;#39;t
21m52s: say order
21m55s: items and that&amp;#39;s where we ended up last
21m57s: week Bookshop order items is not
21m59s: explicitly exposed as part of the
22m1s: service so if we go back here let&amp;#39;s put
22m4s: that back there let&amp;#39;s go back up here
22m6s: and go to Sears there and say CDs Auto
22m11s: expose without the D because the auto
22m13s: exposed is this sort of implicit cap
22m17s: internal not internal but cap machine
22m19s: generated annotation right because Auto
22m22s: exposure of targets is a
22m24s: thing I can still say explicitly I want
22m27s: to auto to expose order items right if I
22m30s: save
22m32s: that everything will restart but now I
22m34s: can go across to here and if I press
22m37s: refresh I can now go directly to order
22m39s: items right not only that but also if I
22m43s: press refresh there we get a to order
22m46s: items in the service endpoint entity set
22m50s: list because we&amp;#39;ve sort of forced it to
22m51s: be exposed we&amp;#39;ve explicitly as a human
22m54s: say expose this right there we go
23m0s: so what can let actually let&amp;#39;s switch
23m3s: back here now let&amp;#39;s switch back uh to
23m5s: here no there there there let&amp;#39;s get rid
23m8s: of that again let&amp;#39;s save that and let&amp;#39;s
23m11s: restart again let&amp;#39;s go back there
23m12s: refresh let&amp;#39;s go back there and we&amp;#39;re
23m16s: back to where we were so we we we&amp;#39;re now
23m19s: just having the benefit the beauty of
23m23s: the automatic Auto Exposition Auto
23m26s: exposure of the composition Target
23m30s: Auto exposure is important because for
23m34s: compositions because we also want to be
23m37s: able to do deep inserts right so if
23m40s: you&amp;#39;re creating a document as Henrik and
23m42s: other people said last
23m44s: week the the the obvious use case for
23m47s: compositions is the classic document
23m49s: structure header and items header and
23m52s: positions
23m53s: right so why don&amp;#39;t we jump to this now
23m56s: deep
23m57s: insert and just do a simple deep insert
23m59s: we could dig into you know put some
24m1s: patches and everything so to do updates
24m3s: as well or upserts or whatever but let&amp;#39;s
24m4s: just do a simple thing for now oh so
24m6s: nikil says um and also but the person
24m9s: the lovely person who asked the question
24m10s: straight away in the greetings this
24m12s: morning ask it again it&amp;#39;s scrolled up in
24m15s: fact no I can I can scroll my finger
24m16s: it&amp;#39;s a touch screen isn&amp;#39;t it wait a
24m17s: minute um how unique is Cap compared to
24m21s: other Frameworks some of them I had
24m22s: listed below for example uniqu event
24m24s: Maes is decoupling um cap is unique in
24m28s: that it is probably the most ENT in my
24m31s: personal opinion the most Enterprise
24m33s: ready
24m35s: um deliberately and wonderfully agnostic
24m39s: framework in terms of persistence layers
24m41s: in terms of languages all right no JS
24m43s: and Java um uh that you could even you
24m46s: could ever ask for right uh and it it
24m50s: Embraces the idea of um declarative DM
24m54s: do I
24m56s: mean so I mean how what would you like
24m59s: to compare it with um you can&amp;#39;t really
25m0s: compare it with event mesh that&amp;#39;s not
25m2s: really a framework a programming
25m3s: framework so let me know um how else you
25m6s: might want to talk about that and think
25m7s: about that but also nikel says would
25m9s: that would this have the same effect if
25m10s: you remove The annotation from the model
25m12s: and added the order items entity in the
25m14s: service yes it would basically yes it
25m16s: would that&amp;#39;s a great that&amp;#39;s a great
25m17s: question so zah says if we have two
25m19s: Services based on our schema will CDs
25m20s: Auto expose exposing both Services yes
25m22s: because CDs the CDs Auto expose is on
25m26s: the on at the schema level let&amp;#39;s call it
25m29s: the persistence layer where we&amp;#39;ve
25m31s: defined our entities and the
25m33s: relationships between those entities
25m35s: okay so yes exactly if we had more time
25m38s: um we try those two things out n and Z
25m41s: ask brilliant questions but the I&amp;#39;m just
25m42s: going to give the answers rather than
25m44s: sort of demonstrate it you maybe you can
25m45s: play with it yourself because I want to
25m46s: get through and get to moving away from
25m49s: an explicit entity definition and using
25m51s: this composition of aspects to have a
25m53s: sort of an inline composition but before
25m55s: we do that let us let&amp;#39;s get rid of
25m59s: um let&amp;#39;s get rid of that for now yeah
26m2s: what we&amp;#39;ll do is we&amp;#39;ll do one of these
26m6s: we&amp;#39;ll try a deep insert what does a deep
26m8s: insert mean
26m9s: basically we want to be able to create a
26m11s: document we want to be be able to create
26m13s: an order so let&amp;#39;s bring that up and um
26m19s: let&amp;#39;s
26m20s: define oh by the way by the way by the
26m22s: way uh in our um little document here uh
26m26s: I&amp;#39;ve got I wrote about a well no not
26m28s: million I what two three or four blog
26m31s: posts uh very recently qac.org and in
26m34s: one all about cap and uh CDs and
26m37s: previewing uh stuff as well and SQL
26m39s: lighting Cloud Foundry non- production
26m41s: and everything and um what was the thing
26m43s: I&amp;#39;m talking about I completely lost my
26m45s: track now um ah what am I talking about
26m50s: I can&amp;#39;t remember I was oh uh I suddenly
26m53s: lost it I suddenly lost it anyway I
26m55s: can&amp;#39;t remember what DJ what&amp;#39;s going on
26m58s: anyway all right
27m0s: so so what we&amp;#39;ll do is we will create oh
27m4s: yes there we go we&amp;#39;ll create what&amp;#39;s it
27m6s: called using services and cap uh oh here
27m10s: we go there avoid design time cap server
27m12s: restarts when maintaining local data
27m14s: files there&amp;#39;s another one as well
27m15s: amazing I forgot about that one let&amp;#39;s
27m16s: put that in as well uh there um
27m21s: there there let&amp;#39;s just put that in there
27m24s: What&amp;#39;s the title of that avoid there I&amp;#39;m
27m27s: going to use this technique right now so
27m30s: oh God I hate that there we go
27m36s: right ah come on God this editor what is
27m41s: going
27m48s: on right that was painful there we go
27m52s: right so I don&amp;#39;t want the server to
27m55s: restart when I start maintaining data
27m57s: files so I&amp;#39;m going to put them in a
27m59s: directory called underscore out which is
28m2s: explicitly one of the things that is not
28m5s: looked at
28m9s: by the um where is it uh by the regex
28m14s: that the the the CDs watch uses to look
28m17s: out for files that are changed okay
28m18s: soore out um in terms of client
28m21s: perspective what is unique um that&amp;#39;s a
28m23s: that&amp;#39;s a really good question um what do
28m25s: you think I&amp;#39;m going to turn the question
28m27s: around what do you think is unique
28m28s: what are the features of cap um what
28m31s: features of cap can you not find
28m33s: anywhere else put in the chat what
28m35s: people think uh why do you why does
28m37s: everybody think cap is unique is it
28m39s: unique um I think that&amp;#39;s a great
28m41s: question um but yeah it&amp;#39;s maybe it&amp;#39;s a
28m45s: little bit too wide for me to be able to
28m47s: answer uh in the time available 827 here
28m50s: we go
28m52s: um right DJ focus focus focus so what we
28m55s: want to do is we want to create a
28m58s: structure a basic structure for a deep
29m1s: insert right remember that in our um in
29m6s: our data files we have orders we&amp;#39;ve got
29m12s: an ID and a comment and Order items
29m14s: where we got the parent ID position and
29m15s: quantity
29m17s: right now I want to be able to let&amp;#39;s say
29m20s: we want to create a new um a new order
29m24s: okay now remember that the uh the ID is
29m27s: defined by cuid aspect so therefore it&amp;#39;s
29m30s: a uu ID and therefore if we don&amp;#39;t Supply
29m32s: it one will be generated for us that&amp;#39;s
29m34s: great but we need to supply other things
29m37s: as well right so I&amp;#39;m going to maintain
29m40s: code um out data let&amp;#39;s call it order new
29m46s: order new order talking of Music New
29m49s: Order uh New Order let&amp;#39;s put in like
29m51s: that order. yaml now I don&amp;#39;t like
29m54s: writing Jason but so I&amp;#39;ll write yaml you
29m56s: see um and so let&amp;#39;s see if it&amp;#39;s a
29m59s: comment
30m1s: um New
30m4s: Order uh and then we&amp;#39;ve got items
30m7s: remember the structure here let me put
30m8s: that across here
30m9s: actually put that
30m12s: there put the schema there there&amp;#39;s the
30m15s: structure so
30m16s: items uh why don&amp;#39;t we
30m19s: say uh position one
30m23s: quantity
30m26s: 10 uh is that right is that I I think
30m28s: that&amp;#39;s right let&amp;#39;s save that that&amp;#39;s
30m31s: formatted actually yes that&amp;#39;s okay uh so
30m33s: let&amp;#39;s repeat that uh there there let&amp;#39;s
30m37s: have four
30m40s: uh
30m41s: [Music]
30m42s: four
30m44s: 40
30m46s: oops more haste less speed DJ more haste
30m49s: less speed 20 there we go now the reason
30m51s: I&amp;#39;ve done that because it&amp;#39;s so easy to
30m53s: create right it&amp;#39;s so easy to create
30m56s: structures in yaml you can type in yaml
30m58s: has its issues as well but as a as a as
31m0s: a human rable format I think it&amp;#39;s pretty
31m3s: cool and then we can actually go into um
31m7s: here and say um B bigger uh let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s
31m13s: go into here and there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s our new
31m15s: order and now we can say
31m17s: yq dot a little bit like you know the
31m21s: identity function in JQ
31m24s: out uh what is it called oh we&amp;#39;re in out
31m26s: already uh data no new order. yaml and
31m29s: we get Jason so let&amp;#39;s put that into new
31m33s: order. Json so much easier look I mean
31m35s: otherwise I&amp;#39;d have to sort of do all
31m37s: those punctuations and open curly
31m39s: brackets Clos curly brackets double
31m40s: quotes colons and everything so we&amp;#39;ve
31m43s: now got a structure and notice what I&amp;#39;m
31m45s: not
31m46s: supplying oh so nikel says Oh e Ian says
31m49s: New Order also same time as 808 yes I
31m51s: think you&amp;#39;re right ABS ex exactly and of
31m53s: course who knows the uh the band that
31m55s: new order was formed from amazing from m
31m57s: field uh not too far away from me um
32m1s: nikil says if we used our own aspect to
32m3s: idea not from sap CDs will it still be
32m5s: core computed wouldn&amp;#39;t we need that
32m7s: annotation if we Define our own oh
32m9s: that&amp;#39;s great what a great question so
32m11s: Niki is sort of sort of pointing out the
32m13s: fact that I&amp;#39;m using this aspect here
32m17s: remember just to sort of cut down on the
32m19s: amount of season that&amp;#39;s generated so we
32m22s: don&amp;#39;t have to look through a load of
32m23s: stuff I I stopped using the uh using
32m26s: cuid from sap CDs common and just
32m29s: defining it here in know lines three
32m30s: through five uh Nik is saying if we use
32m33s: our own aspects already which we&amp;#39;re
32m34s: doing here will it still be called
32m36s: computer yes because the fact that I&amp;#39;m
32m37s: using this type here uid right it&amp;#39;s the
32m41s: uid um type part of this that is related
32m47s: to the um uh Auto comput auto
32m52s: computation autogeneration of the ID if
32m55s: that&amp;#39;s J division exactly J division uh
32m57s: of the them so brilliant question n
32m59s: brilliant question so we we still get
33m1s: that because it&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re using U your uid
33m3s: so now now now now let&amp;#39;s start CDs
33m7s: watch okay and then let&amp;#39;s also open up
33m10s: another terminal here and what we&amp;#39;ll say
33m14s: is well first of all let&amp;#39;s have a look
33m16s: at the curl local uh
33m20s: Local Host
33m23s: 404 uh OD data V4 book
33m28s: shop orders let&amp;#39;s just have look at the
33m30s: orders for now that&amp;#39;ll do uh let&amp;#39;s do to
33m35s: silent and let&amp;#39;s format it as well there
33m38s: we go okay so we got two orders we got
33m40s: first order and second order AC 58 uh AC
33m43s: 5A and
33m44s: 6091 so now what we&amp;#39;ll do is we&amp;#39;ll say
33m49s: um curl and then we&amp;#39;ll re use the dash
33m52s: dash data and point to a file out uh
33m56s: date no New Order . Json so we&amp;#39;ll send
34m0s: that the content of that file which
34m3s: looks like where is it where is it ah
34m6s: there new order do Json there it&amp;#39;ll send
34m14s: that we need to supply the header
34m17s: describing what the content type of the
34m20s: payload is which is application Json
34m22s: header this is normal stuff content type
34m26s: application
34m28s: Json right and where do we want to send
34m30s: it to URL we don&amp;#39;t need the D- URL but
34m33s: let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s put it in anyway URL Local
34m36s: Host lolcat Local Host 404 OD dat V4
34m42s: book shop orders now no let&amp;#39;s see what
34m46s: happens um should we do a verose as well
34m51s: maybe to see even more what&amp;#39;s happening
34m53s: so what are we what are we about to do
34m55s: you&amp;#39;re welcome n that&amp;#39;s a great question
34m57s: all these questions are great so Sunny
34m59s: um put down what you think is unique
35m1s: about cap and then we can that that
35m3s: might help the discussion because I
35m4s: think it&amp;#39;s a really good
35m7s: question maybe and I&amp;#39;m going to ask
35m10s: Daniel Scher uh maybe we should have a
35m13s: sort of a a separate ad
35m16s: hoc uh live stream where we get some
35m19s: people who know a lot more about cap
35m22s: than I do as in somebody from the cap
35m23s: team to discuss these sorts of questions
35m26s: more sort of high level philosophical
35m27s: questions about cap do you think that
35m29s: would be a good idea let me know in the
35m30s: chat let us know in the
35m32s: chat uh that&amp;#39;s really cool so uh what
35m35s: we&amp;#39;re doing here is we&amp;#39;re going to send
35m36s: this entire where is it there this
35m40s: entire Json structure and notice as well
35m43s: I&amp;#39;ve not supplied going back to sort of
35m45s: Nel&amp;#39;s related related to Nel&amp;#39;s question
35m47s: I&amp;#39;ve not supplied the
35m50s: ID the key ID for the orders nor have I
35m56s: supplied the value for the parent right
35m59s: then the parent is
36m1s: this uh managed Association so for that
36m4s: there will be remember will be at the
36m7s: persistence layer a parent uncore ID
36m11s: field at the data definition level right
36m14s: to have this point back to the parent I
36m16s: belong to this parent right we&amp;#39;ve not
36m19s: put that in the where&amp;#39;s my head the
36m22s: bottom uh okay Matias says thank you
36m24s: very good idea very good thank you yeah
36m26s: I think philosophical discussion about
36m27s: cap uh I think that would be really cool
36m30s: okay Matias remind me next week if I&amp;#39;ve
36m32s: forgotten okay or or um
36m35s: anybody what we&amp;#39;re going to do we might
36m38s: even
36m39s: 835 we might yeah okay let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s car
36m41s: with this so items so I&amp;#39;ve not got any
36m45s: Keys whatsoever or any relationships
36m47s: we&amp;#39;ve got an implicit relationship
36m49s: though in the fact that these objects
36m53s: here are inside this array and the array
36m55s: is the value of this items which is is
36m58s: here which is the
37m0s: composition right this is the most
37m1s: beautiful thing so now let&amp;#39;s press enter
37m4s: I might have done something wrong but
37m5s: press enter and see what
37m7s: happens oh there we go oh my goodness oh
37m10s: my goodness look we didn&amp;#39;t get an error
37m12s: and we
37m14s: got in
37m16s: response um let&amp;#39;s just I wonder if we
37m19s: can copy that cat into response. Json
37m25s: and let&amp;#39;s paste that in and then we can
37m27s: do JQ response. Jon we can we can see
37m31s: what we got in response and what we get
37m33s: in response is basically the Json
37m36s: representation the default
37m38s: representation of the resource that
37m40s: we&amp;#39;ve just created with post right we
37m43s: didn&amp;#39;t get any errors so this is exactly
37m45s: what we have supplied here we&amp;#39;ve created
37m47s: a new entity in the entity set and look
37m51s: also what&amp;#39;s happened it&amp;#39;s generated
37m54s: going back to nik&amp;#39;s question well
37m55s: related to nik&amp;#39;s question it&amp;#39;s generated
37m58s: and a guid for us and there is also used
38m3s: in this parent there&amp;#39;s the parent unar
38m5s: it&amp;#39;s used the guid to to point the
38m9s: children back to its parent so there&amp;#39;s a
38m11s: deep insert right as it says here
38m15s: where deep insert update automatically
38m18s: filling in document
38m20s: structures Okay so we&amp;#39;ve got that and so
38m24s: in fact if we go now to um local post
38m28s: let put 404 might be easier um why does
38m31s: it always remember the Bookshop books
38m32s: but not me other things uh 404 go to
38m37s: orders uh oh what&amp;#39;s going
38m41s: on what what what what what what what
38m43s: what did we not orders New Order I&amp;#39;m not
38m47s: expecting New Order what have I done
38m49s: wrong there what have I done wrong get
38m52s: bookshops
38m54s: orders let&amp;#39;s just have a look here
38m58s: what is going
39m4s: on actually let&amp;#39;s have look at the what
39m7s: happened there two1
39m10s: created why didn&amp;#39;t we get
39m15s: the what&amp;#39;s going on am I missing
39m18s: something am I missing something let
39m21s: have a drink of water and think about
39m25s: this uh 4,4
39m28s: four that&amp;#39;s correct am I at the right
39m31s: um Bookshop
39m34s: orders second order first order did it
39m38s: oh it restart did it
39m40s: a of
39m43s: course who spotted what happened who
39m46s: spotted what happened and this is the
39m48s: exact this is the exact oh GL is this is
39m51s: the exact
39m53s: reason why I ended up writing this blog
39m57s: post post or writing a blog post about
40m0s: this thing right this avoid design time
40m3s: cap server restarts when maintaining
40m6s: local data Val what did I just do I
40m8s: created this response. Json and of
40m10s: course what does the cap server do when
40m11s: it&amp;#39;s in watch mode it&amp;#39;ll restart and why
40m14s: and what&amp;#39;s happening when it&amp;#39;s
40m15s: restarting it&amp;#39;s going to reload because
40m17s: we&amp;#39;re using by default the development
40m21s: profile um we&amp;#39;re using I&amp;#39;ve seen a I&amp;#39;ve
40m24s: seen um a comment from Sunny I&amp;#39;ll look
40m26s: I&amp;#39;ll read in a minute Sun
40m29s: um just put in the chat what you think
40m31s: just happened and I I&amp;#39;ll explain slowly
40m34s: right but look here when
40m36s: we created this response.
40m41s: Json it restarted look after the post
40m45s: which was the thing it restarted which
40m48s: of course means as well because we&amp;#39;re
40m50s: running where&amp;#39;s the where&amp;#39;s the um uh
40m53s: package.json remember the package.json
40m58s: our default mode for persistence is in
41m3s: memory so what happens when it restarts
41m5s: it is in ra Rafa said exactly it&amp;#39;s in
41m7s: local so it&amp;#39;s locally in memory only so
41m10s: when it restarts it just loads the
41m11s: orders from here and
41m13s: here and we&amp;#39;ve lost you know you know
41m15s: sort of you know we&amp;#39;ve lost the thing
41m17s: we&amp;#39;ve just added to the persistence
41m19s: there as in let&amp;#39;s call it the UNP
41m21s: persistence layer because it&amp;#39;s just SQL
41m23s: light in memory and of course when the
41m24s: server restarts it&amp;#39;s gone so let&amp;#39;s do
41m26s: that again but this
41m28s: time let&amp;#39;s not create this response.
41m30s: Json so there we go so let&amp;#39;s do that
41m33s: restart there we go so there&amp;#39;s the thing
41m35s: there so that is that super important
41m37s: right this is this is exactly why I&amp;#39;ve
41m40s: now cre I&amp;#39;m now creating files in
41m43s: underscore out because underscore out is
41m45s: one of the places that the restart
41m47s: mechanism doesn&amp;#39;t look for changes right
41m49s: does that make sense so there we go
41m51s: there&amp;#39;s the there&amp;#39;s the two things there
41m53s: now I&amp;#39;m going to go back up here and
41m56s: there we go let&amp;#39;s do that again
41m59s: this time let&amp;#39;s pipe it into JQ directly
42m1s: so we can sort of see a nice pretty
42m4s: output and now let&amp;#39;s go across and
42m7s: refresh there we go we get the New Order
42m9s: right we get the New Order memory not in
42m12s: SQL RAF exactly exactly
42m14s: Rafel th000 points of
42m17s: rafl does that make sense but also let&amp;#39;s
42m20s: have a look orders expand equals items
42m23s: there it is look uh New Order 1 10 20 30
42m26s: 40
42m29s: so we with
42m30s: a a relationship between a header and an
42m35s: item idea expressed via a composition is
42m37s: just such a beautiful thing we can do
42m39s: deep inserts and updates as well right
42m41s: let&amp;#39;s oh let&amp;#39;s just do an update because
42m44s: why not right if we were to say uh viore
42m48s: no sorry Co oh there it is there let&amp;#39;s
42m50s: do that I&amp;#39;m just so used to working not
42m52s: in vs code if I were to say um let&amp;#39;s
42m56s: just add up here items let&amp;#39;s say we
43m0s: don&amp;#39;t want we actually we only want one
43m2s: item right let&amp;#39;s go for that one right
43m4s: let&amp;#39;s go for there there let&amp;#39;s have a th
43m10s: okay now let&amp;#39;s bring that up again the
43m13s: the the ID of our thing is there right
43m16s: so let&amp;#39;s we need that let&amp;#39;s bring that
43m19s: up uh there verose data we&amp;#39;re going to
43m23s: send this data in
43m25s: okay and we&amp;#39;re going to say uh header
43m29s: URL but we we also now need to specify
43m31s: CU we&amp;#39;re changing a specific entity so
43m35s: we need to Def describe that in the in
43m37s: the URL okay so we&amp;#39;re doing an OD data
43m41s: uh operation but
43m43s: instead we&amp;#39;ll say
43m45s: x
43m48s: patch let&amp;#39;s modify that let&amp;#39;s see what
43m51s: happens shall
43m53s: we 200
43m55s: okay ID comment items so now if we go
43m59s: back to here no there where is it there
44m2s: and press
44m3s: refresh we&amp;#39;ve patched that order by
44m7s: saying actually it&amp;#39;s just one item for
44m10s: example and you can imagine how you
44m12s: would need therefore to use patch for
44m16s: example and of course put is also in
44m19s: that same sort of area replacing the
44m21s: entire thing right in fact let&amp;#39;s use
44m23s: let&amp;#39;s use put let&amp;#39;s use put let&amp;#39;s see
44m25s: the difference between patch and put
44m27s: we didn&amp;#39;t I didn&amp;#39;t
44m29s: change
44m31s: um oh we did actually hold on a second
44m34s: let&amp;#39;s just say here yeah let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s
44m36s: let&amp;#39;s follow this up 843 yeah um so Visa
44m40s: yeah W Visa says this default profile
44m42s: issu is very interesting and um uh nikil
44m45s: says if we were to expose uh the order
44m48s: items now and do a post against that
44m50s: entity will it error out or will still
44m52s: generate the parent it won&amp;#39;t generate
44m53s: the parent no if we do a post directly
44m55s: and use that goid in the order item
44m57s: record we I mean we could do it
44m59s: manually um so yeah we can still we can
45m2s: still do it manually but it&amp;#39;s not a good
45m3s: idea right it&amp;#39;s not a good idea so let
45m6s: me go back to Sunny&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s 8:44 already
45m8s: so we got only got 15 minutes so we
45m9s: might extend it to next week oh my but
45m14s: I&amp;#39;m hoping this is okay because we want
45m15s: to understand not only compositions from
45m18s: a a CDS perspective from a core data and
45m21s: services
45m22s: perspective we also want to understand
45m24s: it from a practical perspective how do
45m26s: we use it and what does that actually
45m27s: mean for us as consumers of the service
45m29s: that is defined using compos for example
45m32s: so with put post and patch for example
45m35s: so we&amp;#39;ve done a post to create something
45m38s: new in fact let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s actually let&amp;#39;s
45m41s: restart here so we&amp;#39;re starting from
45m44s: scratch again with just those two orders
45m46s: right and by the way um so let me see
45m50s: what Sunny says in my opinion if a
45m52s: company uses sap for their Enterprise
45m53s: they have the option to use cap for
45m54s: building applications that provide IP
45m56s: features I maybe wrong as I did not have
45m57s: full hands on that&amp;#39;s exactly right no
45m59s: you&amp;#39;re exactly right Sunny um uh so if
46m2s: if a company uses sap for their
46m3s: Enterprise they have the option to use
46m4s: cap for building applications exactly
46m7s: they have two options well they have
46m8s: many options but they have two main
46m11s: options let&amp;#39;s use the word main they can
46m13s: use RP the restful application
46m15s: programming model um and that&amp;#39;s for if
46m17s: you want to use uh appap on the appap
46m20s: stack or if that&amp;#39;s not appropriate for
46m23s: whatever reason then the other other of
46m27s: the two main um recommended approaches
46m30s: Pathways Journeys is Cap the cloud
46m33s: application program which is what we&amp;#39;re
46m34s: talking about and of course then you
46m35s: have the possibility of doing that from
46m38s: a language perspective either with
46m40s: node.js JavaScript or with Java okay um
46m43s: of course you can still because btp the
46m46s: BT what&amp;#39;s it called the business
46m47s: technology platform has uh multiple
46m50s: environments for example Foundry and
46m52s: kubernetes in the form of tea rap
46m53s: kubernetes you can still do bring your
46m55s: own right you can still bring whatever
46m57s: language you want and run whatever you
46m59s: want okay but recommended and also you
47m3s: know supported and Enterprise ready cap
47m6s: and rrap you know what&amp;#39;s not to like and
47m8s: that&amp;#39;s why of course there&amp;#39;s a cap and
47m10s: rrap codejam going on in Paris France
47m12s: right now as opposed to Paris Texas supp
47m15s: um uh so douglas douglas welcome sa was
47m19s: Douglas longtime friend of the hands on
47m21s: Sab Dev show Welcome Back Douglas yes of
47m24s: course not wanted to post against a
47m25s: contained entity just yes
47m28s: nikel curiosity is the most important
47m31s: thing that we should all have in these
47m33s: sessions and generally right as
47m35s: developers that&amp;#39;s the best skill skill
47m38s: is it a skill that&amp;#39;s the best
47m41s: characteristic to keep strong in one&amp;#39;s
47m44s: self C curiosity right this is why we&amp;#39;re
47m48s: finding all these things out so let&amp;#39;s be
47m52s: curious and dig in a little bit more to
47m55s: the difference between shall we put it
47m57s: in the chat whether we shall uh the
47m59s: difference
48m0s: between from an HTTP verb perspective
48m3s: post put and Patch okay it&amp;#39;s slightly
48m7s: confusing that they all begin with P in
48m8s: my
48m9s: brain but post is where you want to
48m12s: create a new resource effectively
48m15s: semantically okay so post is used to
48m19s: convey the OD dat operation
48m22s: create okay uh Sunny you&amp;#39;re welcome
48m25s: you&amp;#39;re welcome Sunny um
48m27s: and that&amp;#39;s what we did before so now
48m28s: we&amp;#39;re back to the two basic orders that
48m30s: we&amp;#39;ve got in the CSV files second order
48m33s: and first order in fact going back to
48m35s: what uh what um uh no who said that
48m42s: um I can&amp;#39;t remember who said it sunny
48m48s: Rafael uh anyway oh yes it was wow this
48m52s: default profile issue is very
48m53s: interesting we wez us so yes we could
48m56s: switch to the profile that uses the SQL
48m58s: light
48m59s: database and in fact we will do when we
49m1s: start wanting to explore cascaded delete
49m5s: to sort of see with our own eyes
49m7s: actually whether the children order
49m9s: items are deleted when we
49m12s: delete uh when we delete an order right
49m15s: but we might I can&amp;#39;t believe we might
49m17s: have to go to a third episode to
49m19s: continue with compositions because it&amp;#39;s
49m21s: such an important thing but
49m22s: also DJ stop talking right so we&amp;#39;ve got
49m27s: here let me make it a bit smaller see
49m29s: the sort of structure the first order
49m32s: and the second order
49m34s: okay now let&amp;#39;s go back
49m36s: here and let&amp;#39;s run this again okay so
49m39s: let&amp;#39;s go back here and where is it uh
49m42s: theose there so we&amp;#39;re doing this so
49m45s: we&amp;#39;re going to start let&amp;#39;s put that
49m47s: there uh we don&amp;#39;t really need to see
49m49s: much of that do we so let&amp;#39;s do that like
49m51s: that so we&amp;#39;re going to start by using
49m54s: post which when we use D- data
49m59s: the H in curl the HTTP method that&amp;#39;s
50m1s: used by default is post but let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s
50m3s: be explicit right um minus X actually
50m8s: what&amp;#39;s the um curl what&amp;#39;s the L hand
50m11s: version of uh man curl don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve
50m14s: got man page of curl uh curl help
50m22s: uh let&amp;#39;s put have another thing here man
50m25s: Cur I&amp;#39;ve got man in here yes I have
50m27s: minus X request d d request okay there
50m30s: we go yes
50m33s: request uh there we go
50m36s: so because I quite
50m39s: like putting the long form in post right
50m43s: so what we&amp;#39;re doing here what are we
50m44s: doing we&amp;#39;re now going to send a post
50m47s: request which from an HTTP perspective
50m49s: that&amp;#39;s what the verb is right this in a
50m52s: OD data context translates into let&amp;#39;s
50m55s: make it even
50m58s: all on one line they&amp;#39;re all on one line
50m59s: there we go from OD data perspective a
51m2s: post request translates into a create
51m6s: operation we&amp;#39;re supplying data in this
51m9s: new order file here right there and
51m12s: let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s just create an order with
51m13s: one item
51m16s: okay so Sunny says post create a new
51m18s: record patch update specific fields of
51m20s: record Put update override the record ex
51m23s: beautifully succinct let&amp;#39;s try and see
51m25s: if we can see that in action okay
51m28s: because I think it&amp;#39;s important to to not
51m30s: skip over that sort of thing this is
51m33s: Back to Basics after all right so G oh I
51m35s: just noticed gaming station I miss sap
51m38s: guy so do I in a way I&amp;#39;ll tell you what
51m40s: I miss R2 and the goei and R2 which of
51m43s: course there was no sap guy it was
51m45s: anyway so we&amp;#39;re sending the data in this
51m49s: file as the payload we&amp;#39;re sending a
51m52s: specific header in order to tell the cap
51m55s: server hey the the the the the
51m58s: representation of the payload resource
52m1s: is Jason and we&amp;#39;re sending it to Local
52m4s: 44 o data over here V4 Bookshop orders
52m7s: okay let&amp;#39;s do that
52m9s: bang yeah oh as as we see here curl says
52m13s: unnecessary use of minus X or minus
52m15s: minus request post is already inferred
52m16s: from the fact we&amp;#39;re using Das Dash data
52m18s: okay but we want to be explicit for our
52m21s: own purposes so now we can go across to
52m23s: here and see hopefully there it is
52m25s: there&amp;#39;s our New
52m28s: Order now what we then did what we then
52m33s: did is we did a we did a patch didn&amp;#39;t we
52m36s: so why don&amp;#39;t we say here let&amp;#39;s get rid
52m39s: of the comments and let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s say uh
52m42s: let&amp;#39;s add another see this is this is
52m45s: why I don&amp;#39;t like editing Jason let&amp;#39;s add
52m47s: another position position two with 2,000
52m50s: but we
52m52s: won&amp;#39;t but we won&amp;#39;t have this comment
52m56s: here we won&amp;#39;t include the comment
52m58s: property in the orders level right let&amp;#39;s
53m1s: just save
53m4s: that
53m6s: patch right but we don&amp;#39;t need oh yes we
53m8s: do we still need to patch we need to
53m10s: specify now because patch and put relate
53m14s: to a specific entity whereas post
53m17s: relates to an entity set your imagine
53m20s: posters you&amp;#39;re throwing something into a
53m21s: bucket that bucket is the entity set
53m23s: whereas patch and put you&amp;#39;re your want
53m26s: to Target a specific thing in that
53m28s: bucket right the bucket being the entity
53m31s: set right so where&amp;#39;s our new order there
53m34s: we go there&amp;#39;s 7b1 15 let&amp;#39;s copy that
53m36s: let&amp;#39;s bring it into there and let&amp;#39;s go
53m38s: to the end and say there right same
53m43s: thing let&amp;#39;s see what
53m44s: happens we get 200 okay okay and let
53m50s: refresh so we haven&amp;#39;t changed or lost
53m54s: this comment it&amp;#39;s not gone to null
53m56s: and now we&amp;#39;ve got the two items 1,000
54m0s: and item two
54m2s: 2,000 what happens if we want to do a
54m5s: put a put okay let&amp;#39;s say we want to say
54m9s: I want to completely replace comment um
54m13s: Joy
54m15s: Division and let&amp;#39;s just let&amp;#39;s just have
54m18s: I don&amp;#39;t know just yeah let&amp;#39;s just
54m20s: position
54m21s: two one and one there so let&amp;#39;s do that
54m27s: okay so let&amp;#39;s
54m29s: now replace the whole
54m33s: thing
54m35s: request
54m37s: put for example here uh put there we go
54m42s: and we also get a 200 and we&amp;#39;ve now
54m45s: replaced that it&amp;#39;s still the same ID
54m49s: with all the new data that we want okay
54m53s: does that make sense does that make
54m54s: sense okay
54m56s: it&amp;#39;s
54m58s: 854 maybe we can get
55m1s: in yeah maybe we can get in this thing
55m5s: here cascaded delete yes let&amp;#39;s do that
55m8s: in five minutes let&amp;#39;s do that in five
55m10s: minutes now going back
55m13s: to being able to prove to ourselves that
55m15s: we can let&amp;#39;s do it now first of all
55m17s: right let&amp;#39;s do it now let&amp;#39;s
55m19s: delete request delete let&amp;#39;s do aose we
55m24s: don&amp;#39;t need to send it ah sorry
55m27s: delete we don&amp;#39;t need to send any
55m31s: data um in or in in a in a we don&amp;#39;t need
55m35s: to send a payload for delete nor do we
55m39s: need to send a header describing what&amp;#39;s
55m42s: in the payload because there is no
55m43s: payload so that&amp;#39;s what we need now to
55m45s: delete right so what we what we&amp;#39;re going
55m47s: to try and find out is when we
55m51s: delete the
55m53s: order is that deletion Cascade Ed to the
55m56s: order items now logically you would
55m59s: expect them logically we would we would
56m2s: and sort of philosophically we would
56m3s: hope that&amp;#39;s what happens because it&amp;#39;s a
56m5s: contained in
56m6s: relationship
56m9s: okay uh so but before we do that before
56m13s: we do that let&amp;#39;s go across to here and
56m16s: run that um in profile what&amp;#39;s it called
56m20s: testing mode oh in fact first of all CDs
56m23s: deploy let&amp;#39;s deploy uh so do a deploy um
56m28s: profile testing in fact even before that
56m32s: look we got we got this Bookshop SQL I
56m34s: don&amp;#39;t know what stat it&amp;#39;s in so let&amp;#39;s
56m35s: remove the Bookshop SQL light and then
56m39s: also say CDs deploy CDs CDs
56m43s: deploy profile
56m45s: testing so that should create a Bookshop
56m48s: SQL light there it is and now if we say
56m51s: CDs watch profile testing it&amp;#39;ll start to
56m54s: use not in memory but it&amp;#39;ll start to use
56m56s: this Bookshop do SQL light so of course
56m58s: we&amp;#39;ve got to add that thing back again
57m0s: where is it post let&amp;#39;s add it in there
57m4s: and let&amp;#39;s go across to here refresh
57m6s: we&amp;#39;re back with a sec with the Joy
57m7s: Division right so we&amp;#39;re going to delete
57m9s: that now 2B a etc
57m11s: etc
57m15s: now uh request delete verbos yes let&amp;#39;s
57m20s: let&amp;#39;s have that um there there there
57m23s: there there there and then
57m27s: let&amp;#39;s see so we see what
57m30s: happens 204 no content 204 no that&amp;#39;s
57m34s: exactly what you want from a delete now
57m36s: let&amp;#39;s go back to three now of course
57m39s: we&amp;#39;re looking at the orders here and
57m40s: only expanding on the
57m43s: items so the whole order&amp;#39;s gone from the
57m46s: orders entity set and if we were to try
57m50s: and have a look at the order items
57m52s: because was it called order items
57m57s: because we haven&amp;#39;t explicitly done a CDS
58m1s: Auto expose we took that out again
58m3s: because we don&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t really want it
58m4s: we shouldn&amp;#39;t really have it we can&amp;#39;t see
58m6s: but now what we can do of course is uh
58m10s: SQL light Bookshop do SQL
58m14s: light tables let&amp;#39;s have a look at the uh
58m17s: what&amp;#39;s in there so if we now have a look
58m19s: at select star from um org Q macro uh
58m26s: order items what are we expecting we&amp;#39;re
58m30s: only expecting to see go back here one
58m34s: two three order items rather than three
58m37s: plus however many were in that thing
58m39s: three plus I don&amp;#39;t know yeah
58m41s: those and there they are so they&amp;#39;ve been
58m44s: deleted remember the actual let&amp;#39;s get
58m46s: rid of that remember the actual guid of
58m49s: the um New Order that we created it was
58m52s: 2ba A4 right 2ba A4 that&amp;#39;s not in there
58m55s: as a paent anything so we&amp;#39;ve got a
58m57s: cascaded
59m0s: delete I
59m2s: think I think that&amp;#39;s enough to
59m5s: cover we&amp;#39;ve covered Auto exposure we&amp;#39;ve
59m8s: covered cascaded delete we&amp;#39;ve covered
59m11s: deep insert and update I think we&amp;#39;re
59m14s: okay I think we&amp;#39;re okay suddenly it&amp;#39;s
59m16s: all coming
59m17s: together I&amp;#39;ve just noticed here oh my
59m19s: goodness me um questions questions
59m21s: questions last two so uh Sunny says I
59m24s: miss the waiting time that we Pro screen
59m25s: that took some time just talk the
59m27s: window okay I can&amp;#39;t remember that but
59m29s: anyway um zahed says is it possible to
59m31s: deploy or host cap o data service on a
59m33s: root server with postest what do you
59m35s: mean by a root server um zahed what type
59m38s: of licenses are required in such case
59m40s: where to Define information related to
59m41s: licenses oh my goodness me so cap at the
59m43s: moment is uh governed by the um sap
59m46s: developer
59m47s: license uh so go and check out the sap
59m50s: developer license um I think that
59m53s: originated for Hanner Express I&amp;#39;m not
59m55s: sure sure um but anyway it&amp;#39;s covered by
59m58s: the Sab developer license I&amp;#39;m not a
59m59s: lawyer and um licenses is not something
60m2s: that um I know much about or don&amp;#39;t want
60m5s: to know anything about I&amp;#39;m a developer
60m8s: not a lawyer uh but it is important to
60m10s: know what the license is and is SB
60m12s: developer license so
60m14s: um uh so Daniel thank you Daniel I think
60m17s: the cover page of capaya points out
60m19s: really well what C makes cap special
60m20s: jump start and grow as you go start
60m21s: simple and fast focus on domain yes
60m23s: exactly so let&amp;#39;s just remind ourselves
60m26s: capir
60m27s: capir there we go uh the homepage of
60m30s: capir there there this is what
60m34s: differentiates cap from any other
60m35s: framework in my personal opinion jump
60m37s: start grows you go intrinsic Cloud
60m39s: qualities Enterprise best practices and
60m41s: focus on domain cap is amazing right so
60m44s: um Daniel says an intrinsic oh yes okay
60m46s: so Daniel said just on the screen here
60m48s: nikel plus cap is open yet opinionated
60m50s: wait exactly nck you&amp;#39;ve got it it is
60m53s: open but and that&amp;#39;s what we want as
60m56s: developers we want an opinionated
60m57s: framework right conventional over
60m59s: configuration otherwise we&amp;#39;re just
61m1s: inventing stuff every time from scratch
61m4s: by ourselves individually we don&amp;#39;t want
61m6s: that so Visa says you want to update the
61m8s: quantity of a specific item can we do
61m9s: that with this inline aspect of
61m10s: Declaration yes we can yes we can and
61m12s: we&amp;#39;ll do inline thank you for the that
61m14s: the final link we&amp;#39;ll do inline
61m16s: Declarations of aspects just as the
61m19s: start of next week before we move on to
