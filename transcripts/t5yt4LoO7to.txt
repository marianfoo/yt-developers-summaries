5m55s: today is just sort of recap on we what
5m58s: we finished off last week we just just
6m0s: started going into the whole um
6m3s: associations and we&amp;#39;re going to do a bit
6m4s: more associations
6m6s: today so I&amp;#39;m just keep doing this
6m8s: because I&amp;#39;m conscious that you can just
6m10s: like that got half a logo there and you
6m12s: can see the steam from my coffee I&amp;#39;ve

6m28s: more the more chat the better the more
6m30s: comments you know just random stuff it
6m32s: doesn&amp;#39;t matter you know questions
6m34s: opinions it&amp;#39;s all
6m37s: good so I&amp;#39;m going to
6m40s: start I&amp;#39;m going to start off um by uh
6m44s: let&amp;#39;s flip to the main uh scene where
6m47s: are we yes but by just talking about a
6m49s: couple of things that we we collectively
6m53s: discovered um slight weirdnesses there
6m57s: was one I don&amp;#39;t know whether uh uh there
7m0s: are folks on here I&amp;#39;m sure there are
7m1s: folks on here uh do remember this
7m4s: Yogananda good morning to you in Munich
7m7s: in
7m8s: menion welcome one and all um so yeah um
7m12s: one of the one of the weird things that
7m15s: we saw and we sort of got used to seeing
7m18s: um was if you look if you stare at the
7m21s: bottom um of the VSS code edited the
7m24s: status bar I guess you call it and then
7m26s: at certain times we would see I&amp;#39;m just
7m29s: say sa that there there we would say
7m30s: error during type generation C CDs
7m33s: output Channel um and so we we&amp;#39;ve seen
7m36s: that quite a few times and I think there
7m39s: was somebody on the chat that spotted it
7m41s: first of all um oh Raphael says I really
7m44s: liked your interview on Neo oh Raphael
7m47s: thank you for reminding me I&amp;#39;ll share
7m49s: that in fact I&amp;#39;ve jumped straight in and
7m52s: and I wanted to share other things as
7m54s: well relating to videos and things so
7m56s: yes let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s jump there first before
7m58s: diving into this
8m1s: um so where are we uh here we go oh yes
8m3s: um all sorts of stuff first of all uh
8m5s: let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s do that now uh sap
8m8s: devs uh so we got where Ian Ian th here
8m13s: we go Ian th has been maintaining a list
8m15s: of uh co- talks uh so Ian th uh has been
8m20s: the long standing face of Co talk Co
8m25s: talk Co talk Co talk um but uh we sort
8m29s: of re muted it and we now um get more
8m33s: opportunity you&amp;#39;re going to get more
8m35s: opportuni to listen to more people
8m36s: interviewed by more hosts from the
8m39s: developer Advocates team uh including me
8m41s: for example uh and I had the absolute
8m44s: honor and privilege of chatting to David
8m48s:  Dr David I called him Dr
8m50s: David because he is a doctor but
8m52s: he never calls himself a doctor he&amp;#39;s so
8m53s: humble anyway here it is um what a minut
8m56s: as sap c talk click stop ah stop um and
9m0s: uh let me just share that in the old
9m2s: chatar Ronis there we go helmet helmet
9m4s: says David is I&amp;#39;m saying David because
9m6s: that&amp;#39;s how he says his name uh David is
9m8s: amazing he is amazing and Raphael uh yes
9m11s: exactly so there if you haven&amp;#39;t seen it
9m13s: check out uh the interview because it&amp;#39;s
9m16s: all about the way David uses uh neovim
9m19s: and all the really cool stuff so for
9m21s: example you know um neovim has a
9m24s: built-in language server client for the
9m27s: language server protocol and um it they
9m29s: can uh we can use that and I use this as
9m31s: well to connect to the language
9m34s: server for the cap from cap so the
9m37s: language servers a CDS
9m40s: LSP yeah let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s oh yeah here we go
9m42s: so
9m44s: um uh npm search
9m48s: uh sap CDs
9m51s: LSP so as you know nodejs the node.js
9m55s: flavor of
9m57s: cap comes in the form of a collection of
10m0s: npm packages modules whatever you want
10m2s: to call them libraries and um one of
10m6s: those which is not really part of the
10m8s: core even the core development kit I
10m10s: don&amp;#39;t think I don&amp;#39;t know maybe maybe it
10m11s: is maybe it isn&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t know H um is
10m16s: the CDs language server protocol package
10m19s: the CDs language server implements the
10m21s: language server protocol for Sap&amp;#39;s core
10m22s: data services it can be used in many
10m24s: popularities like Visual Studio code or
10m26s: eclipse or any editor that has a
10m30s: language server either built in like
10m33s: neovim or you know attachable via a
10m36s: plug-in like Vim right so uh David&amp;#39;s
10m40s: interview we talk about that and how he
10m42s: and I for example and helmet for example
10m44s: helmet um yeah you also have a repo uh
10m49s: where is it is it in your um uh let me
10m54s: go to hacky DM let me search for helmet
10m58s: helmet helmet helmet
11m0s: what what&amp;#39;s going on helmet search
11m2s: results helmet tamon here we go um here
11m5s: we go is it here is it here did he put
11m6s: it here somewhere helmet uh oh yes there
11m10s: we go there we go Docker lazy envm
11m14s: that&amp;#39;s what we want that&amp;#39;s from helmet
11m16s: there so this is all about you folks as
11m18s: much as me right let&amp;#39;s get rid of that
11m21s: and that and that so anyway yeah this
11m22s: talks about and it also talks about uh D
11m25s: also talks about the debug adapter
11m28s: protocol uh which is another sort of
11m30s: language server protocol like thing for
11m32s: attaching debuggers to editors it&amp;#39;s just
11m35s: amazing so yeah I really enjoy the
11m37s: interview and I&amp;#39;m very honored uh to be
11m39s: able to chat to him so that was that
11m40s: thanks for the reminder Raphael um so
11m43s: while we&amp;#39;re here uh sap developer news
11m45s: the latest as in it came out last night
11m47s: I always I I still think sap developer
11m49s: news is like a Friday thing but you know
11m51s: we publish it now in the Thursday
11m53s: evening um so there&amp;#39;s the sap developer
11m56s: news and in the the developer news
11m59s: we have lots of different things
12m2s: including it&amp;#39;s April so we&amp;#39;ve got the
12m5s: developers challenge developers check
12m6s: the developer challenge let&amp;#39;s give you
12m8s: that link without that marketing stuff
12m10s: on the end get rid of that um there&amp;#39;s
12m13s: the developer challenge uh being run
12m15s: this week this week this month by uh our
12m18s: good friend and colleague Daniel Robi uh
12m21s: which is awesome it&amp;#39;s all about sap
12m23s: build apps and everything that&amp;#39;s really
12m24s: cool so that&amp;#39;s that by the way uh the
12m26s: news item that I recorded the two news
12m28s: items I recorded that one there for
12m30s: example uh here I thought you know I
12m32s: went for a run a day before yesterday I
12m34s: thought oh yeah here&amp;#39;ll be a good place
12m35s: to uh record the news so there is uh one
12m39s: side of the balance beam of the lock
12m41s: gate and then I for the other for the I
12m43s: think I was recording something on
12m44s: terraform and the the terraform provider
12m46s: sbtp and then I thought you know
12m49s: different view I turned around went on
12m50s: the other side of the lockgate balance
12m52s: beam and recorded so that&amp;#39;s basically
12m54s: literally the other side and where that
12m56s: is I thought I&amp;#39;d show you I&amp;#39;m actually
12m58s: more here at the moment in a place
13m1s: called burka um and this is the Le and
13m4s: Liverpool Canal down here and that goes
13m6s: to Wigan and that way goes to Liverpool
13m8s: but there&amp;#39;s a junction here with the the
13m10s: rufford branch and the canal goes up
13m12s: there and that Junction there I was
13m14s: standing basically there when I recorded
13m16s: it so yeah there we go that&amp;#39;s a little
13m18s: bit of background
13m20s: information anyway anyway anyway um get
13m23s: rid of the sap developer news and that
13m26s: one there there is the March release
13m29s: piece of cap that just came out that&amp;#39;s
13m32s: also covered by Kevin uh Reimer in um in
13m35s: the news yesterday so yeah check out the
13m38s: March release of cap all releases all
13m41s: the time amazing and now so let&amp;#39;s get
13m43s: back to where I was where I was if I
13m47s: again if I save this we get error during
13m49s: type generation CDs output so I talk to
13m51s: the wonderful big brain people in the
13m53s: cap team and they told me or specific
13m55s: person told me yeah this is to do with
13m57s: an experimental sort of beta type thing
13m59s: to do with types so this is this is up
14m2s: your street helmet I think anybody else
14m5s: helmet uh let tell us a little bit in
14m7s: the chat about uh typescript and cap and
14m11s: what you do good morning Henry good
14m13s: morning and
14m16s: welcome um so what was I talking about
14m19s: oh yes so this error
14m21s: occurs because of a certain
14m24s: setting that&amp;#39;s in the extension the the
14m29s: um sap CDs language B extension for vs
14m32s: code and it&amp;#39;s still be us so they&amp;#39;re
14m34s: still trying to work out the best way of
14m36s: sort of approaching this but basically
14m39s: in order to stop this happening if you
14m41s: want to stop this happening save you
14m43s: know we don&amp;#39;t want these Errors By the
14m45s: way the output Channel output I never
14m47s: knew what an output channel was in vs
14m49s: code CDs where is it CDs there we got
14m51s: all these errors look installs cap JS
14m54s: CDs typer as dependency of a project to
14m56s: enable type generator in this project
14m58s: that is where the error is coming from
15m0s: why is this happening it&amp;#39;s trying to
15m3s: generate types because in the in the
15m6s: default settings um in the uh
15m11s: CDs
15m12s: types type generator is enabled okay
15m16s: let&amp;#39;s close that minute the tent so if
15m18s: you turn that
15m19s: off okay and then I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll try and
15m22s: recreate this error right if I save that
15m26s: now we don&amp;#39;t get the error so there we
15m28s: go a little bit a background but also a
15m30s: bit more of a
15m33s: background one of the other things that
15m35s: we
15m37s: saw um and we&amp;#39;ve s again somebody
15m40s: spotted it remember when we had um let&amp;#39;s
15m43s: go to here and we had for example um
15m46s: place of
15m48s: birth uh country and we wanted to use
15m51s: the
15m55s: country country can I do that there we
15m58s: go so that
16m0s: now um generates uh where are we what we
16m4s: doing what we doing what we doing uh
16m6s: that
16m7s: generates CDs
16m9s: compile to to
16m12s: edmx services. CDs that now
16m17s: generates um where somewhere in
16m20s: countries so we get the countries type
16m23s: from sap CDs Comon right we&amp;#39;ve seen that
16m25s: before we don&amp;#39;t need to go in again uh
16m27s: helmet yes this helps reducing Boer
16m29s: plate code for cap projects exactly
16m31s: thank you elmet thank you
16m33s: elmet but we always got this weird
16m35s: imported artifact country is not used in
16m37s: this source file and we were shouting
16m39s: yes it is there it is right uh good
16m42s: morning Joseph and welcome to you good
16m44s: morning
16m46s: everybody and um so I raised an issue uh
16m50s: internally
16m52s: and just to just to show you that what
16m54s: we do here on this channel is important
16m57s: um the uh whole person
17m1s: uh um uh what&amp;#39;s his
17m4s: name Christian of course Christian he
17m6s: said oh yeah oh blah blah blah I&amp;#39;ll fix
17m8s: it so basically we&amp;#39;re going to get a fix
17m11s: because we on the hands onb Dev live
17m13s: stream the live stream posy saw it so
17m16s: and I was looking at the fix here and I
17m18s: I like what the heck is that I&amp;#39;ve seen
17m20s: that before and I remember now has
17m23s: anybody seen this right this is
17m26s: called was it called the
17m29s: the the the nullish coalescing
17m31s: assignment or something let&amp;#39;s just look
17m33s: it up
17m35s: nullish
17m37s: coing assignment let&amp;#39;s look at it on
17m40s: looking on the classic mdn the Milla
17m42s: documentation something or other here we
17m44s: go another nullish coalescing assignment
17m47s: also known as a logical nullish
17m49s: assignment operator only evaluates the
17m51s: right hand operand and assigns it to the
17m53s: left if the left hand up if the left op
17m55s: hand is nullish so this basically here
17m57s: oh I&amp;#39;ve got rid of it this basically
17m59s: where is it h oh no it&amp;#39;s there we still
18m2s: got
18m3s: it basically says um let&amp;#39;s do that there
18m7s: see uh known as the logic only evaluates
18m10s: the right hand up Rand and assigns to
18m11s: the left if the left is so basically if
18m13s: that&amp;#39;s null there it will evaluate that
18m17s: and assign it otherwise it won&amp;#39;t anyway
18m19s: thought it&amp;#39;s always nice to dig in and
18m21s: if you dig into the uh sap CDs extension
18m26s: for vs
18m27s: code CS language support you can
18m30s: download the vsix file we go where&amp;#39;s the
18m32s: where&amp;#39;s the thing where is it where is
18m34s: it there we go you can actually
18m37s: download this is how I S dug into it
18m39s: download the extension and it&amp;#39;s a vsix
18m41s: file but basically a vsx file is
18m45s: just there&amp;#39;s a vsx file if it&amp;#39;s just a
18m47s: zip file unzip minus L sap SE vsx look
18m52s: there it is and it&amp;#39;s all in there so
18m54s: have a look at that and be good morning
18m55s: as well so it&amp;#39;s always it always pays to
18m57s: be curious and also call out things what
18m59s: you don&amp;#39;t understand so that&amp;#39;s being
19m1s: fixed and that fix will work its way
19m2s: towards towards us anyway anyway God
19m4s: it&amp;#39;s 20 17 minutes past 8 already um
19m9s: what I wanted to do is just to sort of
19m12s: let&amp;#39;s get rid of that again um let&amp;#39;s go
19m14s: here and no no that one Ono undo undo
19m18s: there we go that&amp;#39;ll do
19m21s: right let&amp;#39;s dig into associations a
19m24s: little bit more who remembers who
19m26s: remembers way back when two weeks ago
19m28s: when we did dis
19m30s: Association we&amp;#39;ve got some data in here
19m33s: get scod thing we&amp;#39;ve got some data in
19m35s: here bookshops authors and Bookshop
19m38s: books and we
19m40s: added the author
19m43s: ID column into the CSV now what I wanted
19m47s: to
19m49s: just focus a little bit more on today is
19m54s: the language in kaay that talks about
19m57s: these associations so in
19m59s: Capa
20m1s: capir so apologies to Kiara and anybody
20m4s: else from um Italy um I&amp;#39;ll probably say
20m7s: capaya where of course I should really
20m9s: be saying capir but anyway so there some
20m12s: apologies oh I&amp;#39;ve got something to share
20m13s: about that as well um get rid of that
20m15s: get rid of that if we have a look in in
20m18s: fact we know where it is right we&amp;#39;ve
20m19s: seen it before in the cookbook domain
20m22s: modeling probably one of the most
20m24s: important places you need to sort of be
20m26s: sort of focusing on here let&amp;#39;s put that
20m27s: in there as well
20m29s: in the domain modeling um this is what
20m32s: we&amp;#39;re looking at one of the Core
20m33s: Concepts
20m34s: associations so associations capture and
20m37s: Def and you know allow us to Define
20m39s: relationships between entities we know
20m41s: that and what we added in fact why do we
20m44s: do this let&amp;#39;s put that there and then
20m46s: put that there make that a couple
20m49s: smaller there we go is that is that um
20m52s: is that too small maybe one bigger we
20m54s: don&amp;#39;t need that bit either okay fine so
21m0s: managed 21 associations so we&amp;#39;ve got at
21m2s: the moment all we&amp;#39;ve got is this 21
21m5s: Association and it&amp;#39;s a managed
21m7s: Association I wanted to dig in a little
21m9s: bit to what that meant when we when we
21m13s: Define this
21m15s: Association what happened is that we
21m17s: suddenly got in our
21m22s: sequel an extra field and in fact we can
21m26s: we can play around with this a little
21m27s: bit and we can see because this this
21m29s: this sort of exploration allows us or
21m31s: encourages us to use other cap
21m35s: tools to get to know them a little bit
21m37s: better right um so is this making sense
21m39s: let me know if it&amp;#39;s making sense so we
21m40s: can say CDs
21m42s: compile uh and I was playing around with
21m44s: this um earlier this week uh and I&amp;#39;ll
21m48s: show you what I mean by playing around
21m50s: with CDs
21m52s: compile d-el or Dash question mark let&amp;#39;s
21m55s: just make that full screen for a second
21m57s: this allows us to
21m59s: compile or
22m2s: translate models as in CDs stuff like we
22m8s: have in
22m10s: here right two different um output
22m16s: formats Now by
22m19s: default it will compile compile to CSN
22m23s: or season so CSN and again I&amp;#39;m going to
22m28s: apologize in advance
22m30s: this this is the way I
22m33s: learn and I&amp;#39;m um little smile a from K
22m37s: thank you k for understanding this is
22m39s: the way I learn and I&amp;#39;m hoping let me
22m42s: know in the chat I&amp;#39;m hoping this is the
22m43s: way that you like to learn too by
22m46s: staring at digging in going
22m49s: deep as well as you know along so CDs
22m55s: compile we know or you may have heard
22m57s: that CS n or season is the sort of the
23m0s: internal representation of the models
23m4s: that we
23m6s: Define now I wonder
23m10s: if I wonder if yes okay um let&amp;#39;s put
23m13s: that back over on display three for a
23m17s: second and what I will do actually is
23m20s: bring
23m21s: in my terminal because I can do more
23m24s: things in the terminal you can do it
23m26s: here as well but the terminal might be
23m27s: might be nice to use let&amp;#39;s put that on
23m29s: that side as
23m31s: well um and let me go to let me go to
23m39s: um B2B there right
23m42s: and yeah okay perfect
23m47s: now what I will do is say CDs
23m52s: compile to season now
23m56s: actually let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s do it one one one
23m58s: thing at a time one step at a time it
24m0s: will tell us you must specify a model to
24m4s: compile okay let&amp;#39;s and what does that
24m6s: mean well we&amp;#39;ve got here let&amp;#39;s get rid
24m8s: of that again we&amp;#39;ve got here our model
24m11s: in a file called services. CDs so let&amp;#39;s
24m14s: do do that CDs compile to CSN services.
24m19s: CDs and we get a ton of stuff right
24m22s: let&amp;#39;s have a quick
24m24s: stare at that there&amp;#39;s loads of it there
24m28s: loads of it now
24m31s: um why is the load know this is super
24m34s: short
24m35s: here but here we&amp;#39;ve got an absolutely
24m41s: ginormous converted internal
24m44s: representation of that
24m48s: okay why because actually what it&amp;#39;s
24m51s: doing is it&amp;#39;s
24m53s: compiling all of the stuff in here as
24m55s: well because we&amp;#39;re sort of importing
24m57s: this right
25m0s: so in order let me let me just um go
25m2s: across to Here let make that really
25m4s: small a bit smaller anyway so we you
25m7s: know this is sort of masking us being
25m9s: able to sort of get our brains around
25m12s: what we really want to look at which is
25m14s: you know what&amp;#39;s in the the Bookshop
25m18s: service so what we could
25m20s: do is we could in because we&amp;#39;re only
25m24s: importing sap CDs common so that we can
25m27s: have the cui ID but if we have a look in
25m29s: sap CDs common we know and we we can
25m32s: remember can&amp;#39;t we do CU ID this is an
25m35s: aspect so basically we can we can Define
25m38s: our own cuid aspect and sort of get rid
25m41s: of just for the purposes of keeping
25m43s: things keeping the compile version short
25m46s: why don&amp;#39;t we do that um tell you what we
25m49s: yes um yes okay why don&amp;#39;t we um let&amp;#39;s do
25m55s: this as well so we&amp;#39;ll say um list
25m59s: services. CDs which is just list it just
26m2s: list the file name and we use the
26m4s: amazing enter function ENT which will
26m9s: watch for those files listed and run a
26m11s: script or run something every time that
26m13s: changes right so we can say enter minus
26m15s: C which means clear screen
26m18s: um CDs compile to edmx services. Json uh
26m25s: service. CDs so and it will run it for
26m28s: the first time the first time you do it
26m29s: okay so let&amp;#39;s just there we go let&amp;#39;s
26m32s: have that small so we can sort of see it
26m33s: see the whole thing you know we don&amp;#39;t
26m35s: need to read it but you can see the
26m37s: shape of things let me know Helmont
26m39s: you&amp;#39;re always good at let me know how
26m40s: big and small fonts are let me know if
26m43s: that&amp;#39;s still sort of okay just as a as a
26m45s: picture of what&amp;#39;s going
26m47s: on because what we can what we should be
26m49s: able to see here is we have um in our
26m54s: books entity and our author&amp;#39;s entity an
26m58s: ID element called key which is a key we
27m1s: can see it here um I&amp;#39;ll do it here as
27m4s: well uh CDs compile to
27m7s: edmx services. Json uh we can see here
27m13s: um uh property name there we go there
27m16s: there we got that one in books and we
27m19s: get that one in uh authors okay that&amp;#39;s
27m22s: what we want so Kiara says so Garfield
27m24s: says um why does it not import CID only
27m28s: and not the whole common that&amp;#39;s a good
27m31s: question now I I suspect I suspect and
27m35s: maybe Daniel uh s might be able to
27m37s: answer this might not be able to answer
27m39s: this my go feel and and this is I I did
27m41s: wonder about this as well Garfield I was
27m43s: thinking I wonder if people will ask
27m44s: this because I I&amp;#39;m asking this as well
27m46s: in my own
27m48s: brain I
27m50s: suppose in order for the compiler to
27m53s: work it needs to bring in everything
27m56s: because cuid May rely on other things
27m59s: inside that
28m0s: file okay so for example if we brought
28m3s: in if we bring in
28m5s: country for
28m9s: example and you see also refresh if we
28m11s: bring in country if we have a look at
28m14s: what country is it&amp;#39;s a type but the
28m18s: definition of that country thing that
28m21s: type in this
28m23s: case relies upon other stuff in this
28m27s: same file Association to sap common
28m29s: countries and sap common countries is
28m31s: inside this sap common
28m34s: context and that itself is defined as an
28m38s: entity which is decorated with an
28m42s: aspect called Cod list which is also in
28m45s: this file okay so my small brain thinks
28m50s: that the answer to the question that
28m52s: you&amp;#39;re asking Garfield which is a super
28m54s: super question is because
29m0s: importing just one thing as in importing
29m4s: just cuid in many ways make sense to us
29m8s: humans but in other ways can&amp;#39;t
29m11s: necessarily be sort of resolvable
29m14s: because you know how much what does that
29m17s: one thing mean you know you&amp;#39;d have to
29m19s: sort of dig into all the sort of
29m22s: descendant um requirements to to make
29m25s: that a thing to to to to sort of the to
29m27s: rify
29m28s: that
29m29s: cuid import does that make sense I I
29m32s: think that&amp;#39;s what the answer probably is
29m36s: um I can&amp;#39;t think of any other way of
29m40s: doing bringing things in from a from a a
29m43s: library like sap CDs common without
29m45s: bringing in the whole thing because
29m46s: you&amp;#39;re going to need lots of other bits
29m47s: and pieces in there does that make sense
29m48s: Vis good morning uh sorry you you um I&amp;#39;m
29m53s: apolog I apologize for confusing you
29m56s: about this uh live schedule
29m58s: it&amp;#39;s my fault um I just got the day
30m0s: wrong when I scheduled it for some
30m3s: reason I thought Friday was the 4th of
30m4s: April and I didn&amp;#39;t check because I&amp;#39;m an
30m6s: idiot so uh it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not your fault and
30m9s: there&amp;#39;s no reason for you to be confused
30m10s: apart from the fact that it&amp;#39;s me that
30m12s: confused you and everybody else so sorry
30m14s: about that so uh Garfield put in the
30m16s: chat whether that makes sense uh or
30m18s: whether you have a different idea um all
30m20s: ideas are welcome of course let&amp;#39;s get
30m22s: rid of that again there
30m24s: so at the moment let me do that again
30m27s: let me bring that there and we&amp;#39;ll do
30m29s: that as well list services do enter
30m33s: minus c c this compile there we go so we
30m35s: get all of that and in
30m38s: fact in fact in fact in
30m43s: fact Ah that&amp;#39;s a what a beautifully
30m46s: succinct way of saying it yes it would
30m47s: need the entire type hierarchy see this
30m50s: is why this show is all about you folks
30m53s: as much as it is about me we&amp;#39;re together
30m56s: on this so perfect in here what&amp;#39;s the
30m58s: sort of the second level thing
31m1s: um definitions definitions so if we say
31m5s: here see JQ definitions
31m11s: definitions make that bigger again
31m15s: definitions uh Keys what have we got
31m19s: there we go oh okay that&amp;#39;ll do that&amp;#39;ll
31m21s: do okay so we&amp;#39;ll do that right so we&amp;#39;ll
31m23s: say here
31m26s: um put that in a in put that in
31m30s: quotes oh what&amp;#39;s going on quotes and
31m33s: then
31m34s: say um list services. CDs
31m38s: ENT uh minus C and then we&amp;#39;ll have bash
31m41s: minus C and pass that whole thing to
31m43s: bash there we go so now we&amp;#39;ve got a a
31m47s: slightly
31m48s: better there we go there we go we can
31m50s: sort of
31m51s: see um let&amp;#39;s do that again I&amp;#39;m just
31m53s: trying to make it work with
31m59s: is that okay so we can see everything on
32m1s: the same
32m2s: screen uh Garfield says oh Daniel Scher
32m4s: says to my knowledge using from will
32m6s: always bring in the full content even if
32m8s: you only use Parts yes and I think
32m10s: Daniel thank you for confirming that and
32m12s: I think that the reason that we discuss
32m14s: that that Garfield also stated here I
32m17s: think that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a very sensible
32m19s: reason you know logically I couldn&amp;#39;t see
32m21s: that uh working otherwise um get rid of
32m25s: that line there there we go so now
32m28s: there we go there we go we can see all
32m30s: of the
32m31s: entities in the season that are
32m35s: being emitted in the compilation to CSN
32m39s: in
32m40s: CSN uh did you spot the little preview
32m43s: as icon that appeared on the edit of CDs
32m45s: files no where whereabouts Daniel uh oh
32m49s: uh previe what you mean inv vs code what
32m52s: is going on uh let&amp;#39;s have a look um
32m55s: little icon help me out here uh preview
32m58s: as preview as what little icon not open
33m3s: with
33m5s: uh what preview where where do you mean
33m8s: Daniel you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re making us uh
33m10s: very excited here but what what did you
33m13s: spot the little preview as icon that
33m14s: appeared on the editor for CDs files
33m17s: um there maybe I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t know
33m20s: what you mean I don&amp;#39;t know what you mean
33m21s: I&amp;#39;m being too
33m22s: stupid uh put it in words that small
33m25s: words that I would understand and have
33m27s: look at it Perfect Right uper Corner oh
33m29s: right uper
33m31s: corner is that it
33m33s: preview oh see I&amp;#39;ve never seen that icon
33m36s: before preview as
33m39s: oh my godness M you saw it here first
33m43s: folks previe us well previe Oda prev
33m49s: odata od. CSO n interesting let&amp;#39;s do
33m55s: that again oh my goodness see preview as
33m57s: edmx
33m58s: X V4 there we go do we get the same
33m59s: thing yes we oh my goodness so does that
34m3s: mean does that mean that if we check if
34m5s: we add something I don&amp;#39;t know uh title
34m7s: let&amp;#39;s call it fruit
34m10s: string
34m12s: it it changes there look
34m18s: amazing Daniel where dides that come
34m20s: from how long has that been there this
34m23s: is amazing okay this is amazing right so
34m26s: maybe we&amp;#39;ll use that next time
34m28s: uh we could use that now couldn&amp;#39;t we uh
34m30s: well well I&amp;#39;m all halfway down the track
34m32s: now let&amp;#39;s carry on with using this but
34m33s: Daniel tell us in the chat is that a new
34m36s: thing is that is that did that come in
34m38s: the March release I&amp;#39;ve not even looked
34m40s: at the March release I not had time to
34m41s: look at the March release yet um but
34m44s: here we go vs code rocks Garfield says
34m47s: vs code rocks it does indeed it does
34m49s: indeed but sometimes you know some some
34m50s: nerds like me and helmet you know I&amp;#39;m
34m53s: sure sure helmet doesn&amp;#39;t mind me
34m54s: classting him in the same group as nerd
34m56s: group we like build our own tools from
34m58s: small tools is amazing but vs code does
35m0s: Rock it&amp;#39;s pretty cool
35m3s: so so we&amp;#39;re getting all these
35m6s: different see one of the beautiful
35m8s: things about using tools ourselves is
35m10s: that we can then PA the output of CSN
35m12s: for example and you know get it down to
35m14s: the list of things we want to see March
35m16s: release ah okay perfect well let&amp;#39;s have
35m19s: a look at it uh Mar 24 March release oh
35m23s: my goodness me preview
35m30s: there it is folks there it is come on
35m33s: come on DJ keep up put that in there
35m38s: amazing
35m41s: amazing right so anyway where were we uh
35m45s: let&amp;#39;s dig into that a little bit more
35m46s: next week shall
35m48s: we if you want to dig into that next
35m50s: week put it in the chat um
35m53s: so I want to cut down this thing it&amp;#39;s
35m56s: already 8:34 What DJ what are you doing
35m59s: so we&amp;#39;re going to say instead
36m2s: aspect
36m4s: Cy and we&amp;#39;ll Define our own aspect now
36m6s: of course we&amp;#39;re going to get this sort
36m7s: of error saying duplicate definition of
36m9s: top of course yes okay we&amp;#39;re going to
36m10s: get rid this in in fact let&amp;#39;s do that
36m12s: now let&amp;#39;s get rid of that line there and
36m14s: that line there and we&amp;#39;ll have key
36m17s: ID um and it&amp;#39;s a uu ID right let&amp;#39;s
36m20s: format that as well because format
36m22s: format
36m23s: document what&amp;#39;s that option shift option
36m26s: F so can I do that for some reason it
36m28s: doesn&amp;#39;t yeah I tried that it doesn&amp;#39;t
36m29s: work I don&amp;#39;t know why format document
36m31s: anyway there we go now as soon as I save
36m35s: that this should remain the same as in
36m38s: you know it should be regenerated but we
36m40s: shouldn&amp;#39;t see any
36m41s: different and this should should contain
36m44s: a lot fewer entities
36m48s: goup there we go okay so now we sort of
36m52s: cut down so we can start to sort of have
36m54s: a better view of
36m57s: that that worked as well have a better
36m59s: view of compile the CSN there um in fact
37m3s: let&amp;#39;s pass it into JQ right um J JQ we
37m8s: can have a look at it so we can see here
37m10s: we&amp;#39;ve got our definitions we got Cyd we
37m13s: got Bookshop which is a service we got
37m15s: Bookshop do books which is an entity I
37m17s: mean I don&amp;#39;t know about you but
37m21s: this this to me was always a bit of not
37m25s: a bit of a mystery but it was always
37m26s: like always a lot of Json there and it
37m28s: looks complicated and oh my goodness me
37m31s: but actually in understanding exactly
37m35s: how
37m36s: associations not work but are defined
37m39s: underneath and what the what the result
37m42s: of us writing stuff in here
37m48s: is actually having a look under the
37m51s: covers behind the curtain really really
37m53s: helps us learn about the basics right so
37m56s: we got all these different things and we
37m57s: can see also
38m0s: how how I suppose in one way how the cap
38m4s: team how the developers
38m7s: see this stuff see the the services. CDs
38m10s: content see the stuff that we Define we
38m12s: as developers defining CDs or
38m15s: CDL very interesting uh debate going on
38m18s: at the moment in my small brain about
38m20s: whether we should this is really CDL
38m22s: core definition language which is part
38m24s: of the CDs family of languages and this
38m26s: is CSN for schema
38m28s: notation remind me somebody before the
38m31s: before the hour is over to uh share a
38m33s: blog post with you which I uh published
38m36s: this morning in fact um so we can see
38m39s: that there&amp;#39;s a service kind there&amp;#39;s an
38m43s: entity and look the the way that the
38m45s: entity is sort of expressed it&amp;#39;s
38m48s: expressed with its fully qualified name
38m51s: the sort of the name this is where sort
38m52s: of name spaces and service service
38m56s: rappers and context all sort of coales
38m59s: into essentially what this what is the
39m1s: same thing right so helmet says there
39m4s: are two reasons I don&amp;#39;t use vs code it&amp;#39;s
39m5s: getting really slow if you install lots
39m6s: of plugins at least in large projects
39m8s: two you have to use the mouse very often
39m10s: yes uh that&amp;#39;s also the reason I mean vs
39m13s: code is pretty awesome as far as
39m15s: graphical Mouse driven editors go and
39m17s: keyboard shortcuts on vs code are pretty
39m19s: good as well right uh but for example
39m21s: you know keyboard shortcuts here don&amp;#39;t
39m22s: work now it&amp;#39;s probably me overriding a
39m25s: keyboard shortcut with something else in
39m26s: Mac OS don&amp;#39;t know but yeah um but you
39m29s: know as far as that sort of things go
39m31s: vso is pretty nice um so yes I&amp;#39;m I use
39m34s: neovim as well but I&amp;#39;m not using neovim
39m36s: on this live stream for this Back to
39m37s: Basics because I don&amp;#39;t expect people to
39m40s: everybody to use neim I would like to
39m41s: but there we
39m43s: go um so oh number three you can&amp;#39;t use
39m46s: Vim shortcuts the plugins that help here
39m47s: do not work very well yes I&amp;#39;ve got the
39m49s: Vim plugin um what&amp;#39;s it called uh
39m53s: locally installed uh Vim emulation which
39m56s: allows me to move around much better
39m59s: than I would do oops um you know uh
40m2s: otherwise so I do like I do like that
40m4s: this it&amp;#39;s okay it&amp;#39;s good enough let&amp;#39;s
40m7s: get rid that again but yes I I get what
40m8s: you mean so um in here in Bookshop books
40m13s: we have elements and we have author and
40m15s: we can
40m16s: see there Bookshop there&amp;#39;s Bookshop
40m19s: books author and it&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;ve defined it
40m22s: as an association to authors what does
40m24s: that mean internally okay let&amp;#39;s have a
40m27s: look at that what that means
40m28s: internally um we can see it means it&amp;#39;s
40m31s: an
40m32s: association it&amp;#39;s of type I curious that
40m35s: this is this is the word kind here and
40m37s: this is the word type I don&amp;#39;t know why
40m39s: kind we don&amp;#39;t use the the kind property
40m42s: key instead of Tye I I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s a
40m46s: reason for it but anyway Target Bookshop
40m48s: authors Keys reference ID so that&amp;#39;s a
40m51s: really simple that&amp;#39;s a really simple
40m54s: definition that comes about because we
40m56s: used a managed
40m59s: Association okay so what I did this is
41m2s: before I forget to do this now what I
41m5s: did is I wrote a blog post on this as
41m9s: well let&amp;#39;s put that in there um and I
41m12s: wanted to just dig out from all this
41m16s: stuff just those
41m19s: elements of any entity the elements that
41m23s: are of type CDs Association so I can
41m26s: more easily it so I&amp;#39;ve got a little and
41m28s: I&amp;#39;ve added that to our cap B2B thing so
41m32s: in fact if you look here cap B2B I&amp;#39;ve
41m35s: just pushed it this morning it&amp;#39;s there
41m37s: associations. JQ so I&amp;#39;m going to run
41m39s: this little JQ thing here and you can
41m42s: too so let&amp;#39;s do that um
41m47s: associations it will just spit out it&amp;#39;ll
41m50s: spit out all of
41m52s: the entities and within the entities it
41m56s: will spit out
41m57s: any element that&amp;#39;s an associate that&amp;#39;s
42m0s: of type CDs Association so now we can
42m2s: say here um there we go s that J we can
42m5s: say here.
42m8s: associations. JQ instead so we can now
42m12s: start to watch for things that change
42m15s: okay so now let&amp;#39;s do that that that was
42m18s: a very long way round but
42m21s: hopefully we&amp;#39;re now set up and we&amp;#39;ve
42m24s: learned a little bit on the way as well
42m25s: hopefully we&amp;#39;re now set up to start to
42m28s: dig
42m32s: into um where is it
42m35s: um the
42m39s: contrasting because I think it&amp;#39;s really
42m40s: important to understand um what this
42m44s: section is really telling us so we got
42m47s: this thing here use associations to
42m48s: capture relationships
42m52s: fine and it talks about a 21 Association
42m55s: and a managed two1 Association and the
42m57s: succinctness the the the brevity of how
43m1s: this is expressed I
43m4s: can&amp;#39;t
43m6s: State strongly enough how beautiful that
43m9s: is but also how it helps us as
43m14s: developers keep things as clean as
43m17s: possible um what&amp;#39;s that statistic I&amp;#39;m
43m21s: sure I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s a statistic about
43m23s: you know developing and you know you&amp;#39;re
43m26s: reading
43m28s: code 90% of the time and your writing
43m31s: code 10% of the time so to make CDs
43m34s: definitions readable maintainable un
43m39s: comprehensible the shorter and the more
43m41s: succinct the better
43m45s: right so it says here in contrast to in
43m48s: contrast to that we could also use an
43m50s: unmanaged association with all foreign
43m52s: keys and on conditions specified
43m54s: manually now what does that mean that
43m57s: means that actually if we have a look
43m59s: for example let&amp;#39;s go across to here um
44m2s: and do the same thing but instead of
44m5s: compiling to edmx we&amp;#39;ll compile to
44m8s: SQL oh Services sorry yeah services. CDs
44m12s: there&amp;#39;s our SQ well in fact talking of
44m15s: talking of building stuff um bash uh
44m19s: minus C let&amp;#39;s but add that and then pipe
44m21s: that into bat
44m24s: um source is SQL I think is
44m29s: that maybe just B maybe I just need bat
44m32s: actually ah no hold on um Source
44m37s: SQL and plane oh no language SQL
44m40s: language SQL and
44m43s: plane I mean how you
44m46s: know who needs an IDE just got my my
44m49s: terminal is my ID anyway so we can see
44m54s: that without us specifying a foreign key
44m57s: field we get with this managed
45m1s: Association this thing here and that&amp;#39;s
45m4s: why when we did that um let&amp;#39;s do it oops
45m7s: let&amp;#39;s do it here uh clear let&amp;#39;s make
45m11s: that smaller again when we did CDs add
45m15s: data we&amp;#39;re going to get a directory
45m18s: called DB dat CDs add data right there
45m21s: it is DB because that&amp;#39;s a convention DB
45m23s: data and data is a convention with a DB
45m26s: we get the Bookshop books
45m28s: with the fields ready for us to put in
45m31s: some CSV we&amp;#39;ve seen that before
45m35s: right we don&amp;#39;t want
45m38s: DB and that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;ve got in the books
45m41s: we&amp;#39;ve got our ID title author ID and
45m43s: then the IDS of the authors right
45m46s: there&amp;#39;s the authors come on come on put
45m49s: it down there there there&amp;#39;s the
45m52s: authors so we get this for free and we
45m56s: did Cover this very briefly last time
45m58s: it&amp;#39;s like why is it called author uncore
46m2s: ID well if a field is going to be
46m5s: generated for us an element as in in CDs
46m7s: terms it&amp;#39;s an element if an element is
46m8s: going to be generated for
46m11s: us implicitly it&amp;#39;s got to be you know
46m15s: constructed automatically so it it gets
46m18s: constructed from the combination of the
46m22s: from and the two the source and the
46m23s: target so author is the first part and
46m26s: it&amp;#39;s referring to it&amp;#39;s an association to
46m28s: authors and what is the element that&amp;#39;s
46m30s: the key of authors it&amp;#39;s implicit here
46m32s: it&amp;#39;s cuid there look ID uh ID there uh
46m37s: sorry it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s given to us by the
46m40s: cuid
46m42s: aspect and so it&amp;#39;s this one here so it&amp;#39;s
46m44s: author uncore ID does that make sense am
46m48s: I making
46m50s: sense reminds me of uh Talking Heads
46m53s: stop making sense the best albums of all
46m55s: time
46m59s: anyway um
47m2s: so so so so if we were to not use a
47m7s: managed Association as it sort of
47m9s: describes us
47m12s: here what we&amp;#39;d have to do
47m15s: first let&amp;#39;s do it sort of let&amp;#39;s try and
47m17s: do it manually so we can sort of feel
47m20s: our way right let&amp;#39;s just separate that
47m22s: with a line there we
47m23s: go first of all
47m27s: we&amp;#39;d need some sort of foreign key field
47m30s: uh and why
47m32s: author
47m34s: foreign
47m36s: key right so already we&amp;#39;re sort of
47m39s: deviating from you know and and you know
47m43s: somebody else in my team might have a
47m45s: different way in their brain of thinking
47m48s: about the name for this
47m51s: element what type um we can see here we
47m56s: can use this type of type of see when I
47m58s: was be this is this is a really good
48m1s: reason to read capire as well because we
48m4s: get to learn from the examples I&amp;#39;ve
48m6s: never seen type of until last week type
48m9s: of who knew type of there type of uh
48m14s: type of anyway let&amp;#39;s not type
48m15s: definitions Define type Define type uh
48m18s: anyway let&amp;#39;s not go the way down there
48m21s: type of and we so we can refer to type
48m24s: of authors
48m28s: ID okay so basically but but even even
48m32s: here for me in my small brain I&amp;#39;m
48m35s: thinking well yes I know it&amp;#39;s you know
48m38s: author&amp;#39;s
48m40s: colon and we can do a control space to
48m42s: get auto complete through the CDs
48m46s: plug-in the CDs extension for cap right
48m49s: which knows about the structure because
48m50s: it&amp;#39;s PA it and everything so it knows
48m52s: that the two elements in this thing here
48m56s: that referring to our ID and name but if
48m59s: I was right you know if I didn&amp;#39;t have
49m0s: auto complete or I wasn&amp;#39;t using or
49m2s: whatever you know it&amp;#39;s not obvious to me
49m4s: that ID is the thing because ID is sort
49m6s: of subsumed in this cuid aspect but
49m9s: anyway ID so there&amp;#39;s the first sort of
49m12s: little
49m13s: Challenge and then we go across here and
49m16s: we still got to obviously
49m18s: Define this so Association
49m23s: to um sorry where are we
49m27s: uh
49m28s: Association so
49m31s: author uh Association to authors on and
49m36s: now we&amp;#39;ve got to manually
49m40s: construct um on on on on on on uh what&amp;#39;s
49m44s: it say here let&amp;#39;s do
49m46s: that author ID yes there we go author
49m50s: author do
49m53s: ID equals to author forign key right now
49m59s: does that still work let&amp;#39;s see let&amp;#39;s see
50m1s: does that still work save
50m5s: that now well we&amp;#39;ve now got a field in
50m10s: here in the SQL called author foreign
50m12s: key which replaces what we had before
50m14s: called author underscore ID which then
50m16s: also means that in here if we start if
50m18s: we start CDs watch
50m20s: now we&amp;#39;re going to get an error I think
50m22s: are we we going to get an error yes we
50m24s: got an error error on serice SQL light
50m28s: in CS deploy table Bookshop books has no
50m30s: column named author ID because we&amp;#39;re now
50m33s: trying to import something where is it
50m34s: there there author ID so we got to
50m36s: change this to um author foreign key
50m41s: save
50m42s: that oh it&amp;#39;s now it&amp;#39;s work so now it&amp;#39;s
50m44s: working so we so we got to sort of make
50m46s: sure things sort of
50m49s: align there we go so and does that still
50m52s: work let&amp;#39;s go to here and open up Local
50m54s: Host 404 4,000 4 404 I can&amp;#39;t believe I
50m59s: got 404 bookshops authors oh yeah ah I
51m3s: have
51m4s: to does anybody else have a problem
51m8s: with
51m10s: SharePoint when I go to SharePoint which
51m12s: I have to
51m13s: do um internally at
51m17s: sap the resources that SharePoint send
51m20s: back to me which contain HTML are sent
51m23s: back in HTTP responses with the content
51m26s: application
51m28s: Json why and it means that when I have
51m33s: my Json viewer which will of
51m35s: course understanda be try you know any
51m37s: any content coming back that&amp;#39;s got
51m40s: content type application Jason it will
51m42s: try and prettyprint it and format it
51m43s: nicely which is what I want which is why
51m45s: I installed the Json viewer but because
51m47s: SharePoint sends HTML HTML back and says
51m51s: oh it&amp;#39;s application
51m53s: Json the Json viewer trips up and form
51m56s: that&amp;#39;s the SharePoint page and then it
51m59s: all breaks it&amp;#39;s like what is going on
52m1s: SharePoint
52m3s: anyway anyway so now we&amp;#39;ve got this and
52m6s: we can say Bookshop
52m7s: [Music]
52m9s: books and now we can say does that work
52m12s: expand equals author and that works okay
52m15s: but it
52m16s: works only because we&amp;#39;ve made a lot of
52m19s: effort
52m21s: here now does that make sense have I
52m24s: gone overboard but also also look at
52m26s: this
52m27s: we now have a different style of
52m30s: Association instead of let&amp;#39;s um I&amp;#39;ll
52m34s: tell you what let&amp;#39;s do something else
52m35s: let&amp;#39;s do say let&amp;#39;s say here um also
52m40s: author
52m42s: association association to
52m46s: authors let&amp;#39;s have that as
52m50s: well so
52m55s: now we get
52m56s: a different
52m58s: internally this managed Association here
53m1s: generates an internal representation
53m4s: that&amp;#39;s different there&amp;#39;s the also author
53m6s: Keys ref
53m8s: ID and this is our
53m11s: author author CDs Association but it&amp;#39;s
53m14s: an on and then it&amp;#39;s an it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a
53m17s: triplet in an array we get ref auor ID
53m21s: should equal to ref author foreign key
53m23s: okay
53m26s: there we go so that for me is a easily a
53m31s: good enough reason for when we can when
53m33s: it&amp;#39;s a 21 Association using a managed
53m37s: to1 Association so let&amp;#39;s get rid
53m40s: of that that and let&amp;#39;s get rid of that
53m44s: and say
53m46s: author like
53m48s: that and now of course let&amp;#39;s put that
53m50s: back
53m51s: again undo save there right finally in
53m55s: the last few minutes in the last few
53m58s: minutes let&amp;#39;s just
54m0s: add
54m2s: what cap refers
54m5s: to as a to many Association Okay so
54m9s: we&amp;#39;ve got
54m11s: our two1 association going from books to
54m14s: authors and that also means that
54m18s: 404 we can go from
54m21s: books to authors as well in an expand
54m24s: for example we can follow this
54m25s: navigation proc
54m27s: property but what happens if we want to
54m29s: go from
54m32s: authors back to
54m34s: books expand equals books of course we
54m37s: can&amp;#39;t do that because we haven&amp;#39;t defined
54m39s: a navigation property books so let&amp;#39;s do
54m42s: that okay and we can see we need of
54m45s: course a to many because um what we said
54m48s: right at the start is you know a book
54m50s: can be written only by one author in our
54m53s: super simple example but of course an
54m54s: author can write more than one book and
54m55s: that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;ve got Douglas Adams
54m57s: writing two books in our
55m0s: data
55m1s: so here Association to many books but we
55m6s: also need another on condition with a
55m9s: with a too many we can&amp;#39;t
55m12s: have a manag Association because it
55m15s: actually says here um
55m18s: uh where is it says here uh too many
55m21s: associations are unmanaged by Nature as
55m23s: we always have to specify an on
55m25s: condition in order to find that way back
55m28s: from the which
55m31s: author back to the books as this author
55m34s: that book this author that book this
55m36s: author that book okay so we need this on
55m39s: condition so let&amp;#39;s do that now books
55m41s: Associated many
55m42s: books where are we um
55m47s: books to many books on
55m54s: now I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ve seen this sort of
55m57s: what&amp;#39;s it called what what does cap I
55m59s: call it a
56m2s: um where is
56m5s: it uh back backlink back link
56m8s: Association okay we&amp;#39;re linking
56m12s: back right so for the backlink
56m15s: association you&amp;#39;ll see something like
56m16s: this on
56m17s: books. author equals doll
56m21s: self and it always it took me ages to
56m24s: get into my brain
56m26s: what this should be but in my brain I&amp;#39;ve
56m31s: now figured out that what we want let me
56m33s: do that there let just repeat that so we
56m35s: can just sort of repeat that
56m38s: on we start from the source as in
56m42s: here and what we&amp;#39;re using to
56m46s: refer or to what we&amp;#39;re using to name
56m49s: this back link Association IE books so
56m53s: copy that
56m54s: books and then then the dot the other
56m58s: why is it all black there why is it all
56m59s: black Anyway dot I mean we can see from
57m2s: the from the command completion the
57m4s: autocomplete here that we get the
57m5s: possibilities author ID and title which
57m7s: are from the books but
57m11s: basically it needs to refer to the
57m14s: element in the Target
57m16s: entity that is the
57m19s: reciprocal Association
57m22s: author
57m24s: there oops so I don&amp;#39;t know whether do
57m27s: that does that confuse anybody else at
57m30s: first and do self is a nice little sort
57m32s: of um convenience I guess it&amp;#39;s a nice
57m35s: little convenience thing that refers to
57m37s: me as in the um uh the value of the key
57m42s: field which is the ID field does that
57m44s: make sense so now with
57m47s: that we can now run that and it&amp;#39;ll work
57m52s: does that make
57m54s: sense well
57m56s: before we go let me because it&amp;#39;s already
57m59s: 8:56 what is going on with
58m2s: time to have a quick look if you want a
58m5s: quick look
58m6s: at this
58m9s: little this little um uh what&amp;#39;s it
58m12s: called what&amp;#39;s it called
58m15s: associations here that blog post I put
58m17s: the link in the chat to is all about
58m20s: that okay so yeah have a look at JQ have
58m25s: a look at this tell me let me know now
58m27s: if if looking under the
58m30s: surface helps you I think we&amp;#39;re going to
58m33s: do a little bit more on associations
58m35s: next week but then also we&amp;#39;re going to
58m39s: look at the difference between
58m40s: associations
58m43s: and something else super important in
58m48s: associations which
58m50s: are compositions as in sorry something
58m53s: also super important in relationships
58m57s: so we have
58m58s: associations and compositions I&amp;#39;m going
59m0s: to look at the difference and what that
59m2s: means and how they work so let me know
59m4s: in the chat if that is okay for us doing
59m7s: that next week I think for the next few
59m10s: weeks at least I&amp;#39;m going to be around so
59m13s: definitely next week um so yeah thanks
59m16s: very much for joining I&amp;#39;ll see you uh
59m18s: next week we&amp;#39;ll do a bit more on
59m20s: associations and move on to compositions
59m23s: let me know as well have a play with um
59m25s: have a play with the associations JQ
59m27s: have a play with this catch up
59m29s: everything is in the repo cap B2B so if
59m33s: you want to catch up with where we are
59m35s: we&amp;#39;ve got this oh also I did I was also
59m39s: digging in a bit more to CDs compile and
59m41s: I was I wrote this little script to take
59m43s: a snapshot of some CDs Source or CDL
59m46s: source and compile it to CSN CDL SQL and
59m51s: edmx and store those in files so I could
59m53s: do
59m54s: diffs between them so I was sort of you
59m58s: know writing some CDs compiling it to
60m1s: all the things right changing that CDs
60m4s: compiling all the things again and then
