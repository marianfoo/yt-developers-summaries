6m15s: recreate uh the the container uh for our
6m20s: cap B2B uh code Jam sort of uh
6m22s: Shenanigans and I noticed actually I
6m25s: recreated the container and I um went in
6m28s: here and said CDs V CDs version and all
6m31s: of a sudden it&amp;#39;s like Christmas has come

7m13s: said I was noticed that we have uh CD
7m16s: SDK 7.6 suddenly and that&amp;#39;s because you
7m20s: know um I rebuilt the container and
7m22s: because cap B2 be B2B uh because I
7m25s: rebuilt a container um in the rebuilding
7m28s: sorry rebuilt the container image let&amp;#39;s
7m30s: get the terminology right uh the image
7m33s: definition in the docker file says go
7m35s: and install a little bit bigger go and
7m37s: install cdsd K so we install it fresh
7m41s: from npm and as you can see published
7m43s: two days ago bleeding edge we&amp;#39;re are now
7m46s: on 76.0 now normally only a few days
7m50s: later we get some awesome release notes
7m52s: relating to that so again this is this
7m54s: is sort of just making you aware of you
7m57s: know the the Cadence of cap releases and
8m1s: where to find information you know this
8m2s: is what I keep I keep my eye on this in
8m5s: terms of you know what&amp;#39;s the latest
8m7s: release
8m8s: 7.6 I can check in the release notes now
8m11s: the release notes Here in in the capaya
8m13s: in a cap uh is not Vladimir Vlad and
8m16s: welcome to you uh you&amp;#39;re welcome thank
8m19s: you for the stickers vadir says you&amp;#39;re
8m20s: welcome you&amp;#39;re welcome you&amp;#39;re welcome
8m21s: I&amp;#39;m running out stickers so if anybody
8m22s: else wants any stickers send me a uh you
8m25s: know private message somehow on uh
8m27s: masteron or on LinkedIn with a postal
8m29s: address I can send some but I&amp;#39;m running
8m30s: out so you know if you want some get in
8m33s: there um so we can see the sort of the
8m35s: Cadence now very shortly we should see
8m38s: the release notes for January 2024 which
8m41s: basically sort of you know align to this
8m43s: new 7.6 release anyway we&amp;#39;re not going
8m45s: to look into all the new release
8m46s: features right now normally in sap
8m48s: developer news we talk about the new
8m50s: release so you know look out for that in
8m51s: the developer news if you want to so
8m53s: that&amp;#39;s that that&amp;#39;s that uh let&amp;#39;s get rid
8m55s: of that and leave that there for now so
9m0s: what I uh what I wanted to do was just
9m1s: to finish off where we left off last
9m4s: time because so many brilliant questions
9m6s: so ask questions all the time give me
9m8s: your opinions ask questions no question
9m10s: too basic too simple where we were last
9m13s: time we was we were we installed the
9m15s: lint Plugin or the the add-on let&amp;#39;s call
9m19s: it not plugin that&amp;#39;s an overloaded word
9m21s: in in cap terms but um but so what I&amp;#39;ll
9m24s: do is I&amp;#39;ll
9m25s: recreate uh and we&amp;#39;ll do it in volume
9m27s: one go right and then we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll have a
9m29s: look quickly at the linting thing which
9m30s: we sort of you know got distracted and
9m32s: didn&amp;#39;t finish off at the end and then
9m33s: we&amp;#39;ll go into CDs watch if that&amp;#39;s all
9m35s: right so ask questions comment direct us
9m39s: just say whatever you want in the chat
9m40s: because that&amp;#39;s what what makes it even
9m41s: better so C CDs in it um and we also
9m45s: added the uh tiny sample from Elton John
9m48s: um but also We&amp;#39;ll add at the same time
9m51s: the lint mechanism which we know we
9m53s: added that separately last time book
9m56s: shop uh and then we&amp;#39;ll also go into that
9m59s: uh directory once everything&amp;#39;s done
10m1s: right um so as you can see here yes as
10m4s: you can see it&amp;#39;s adding feature no Jess
10m6s: we didn&amp;#39;t ask no but if you look in the
10m8s: source code remember uh last episode we
10m11s: did a bit of a search on the cdsd K the
10m14s: globally installed CDs development kit
10m16s: and we found where the Jane air basic
10m19s: data came from in a similar way you can
10m21s: find out why it will default to add uh
10m25s: the node.js feature okay you know just
10m27s: so it&amp;#39;s all you know the sources there
10m29s: for us to look at and understand it&amp;#39;s
10m31s: added the tiny sample which is basically
10m33s: you know a little a little book entity
10m35s: and a couple of records and then
10m37s: exposing that book entity through a
10m39s: service catalog service and we also
10m42s: added feature link which then asked us
10m43s: do we want to install for example um uh
10m46s: code package.json uh if we want to
10m49s: install um these two things es lint
10m52s: plugin the actual cap specific CDs
10m54s: plugin for ES lint and Es lint itself
10m57s: and then what we did was we had a quick
10m59s: look at one of the rules one of the
11m0s: linting rules that basically said you&amp;#39;re
11m3s: not allowed to have let&amp;#39;s open uh the uh
11m7s: data
11m8s: model uh oh not code uh there we go I
11m12s: quite like sort of saying open it with
11m14s: with text right is quite good um so what
11m17s: we did was we added a dollar prefix to
11m20s: you know a property name uh because that
11m22s: is not really something we should be
11m25s: doing and that&amp;#39;s what we want ly to be
11m27s: catching and so what I did then was let
11m29s: me go to there what we did then was let
11m31s: me put my face down the bottom maybe uh
11m34s: we a CDS lint and we said dot which is
11m36s: basically lint everything in you know in
11m38s: this in this location which is this dire
11m40s: we could actually leave that off it&amp;#39;s
11m42s: the same thing we did a debug but we
11m43s: won&amp;#39;t do the debug now and what we got
11m47s: uh were two error messages uh oh sorry
11m49s: two what CDs links oh what what what oh
11m53s: I&amp;#39;ve not saved it ah uh save uh there we
11m56s: go uh there we go that&amp;#39;s better that&amp;#39;s
11m58s: better better do it again DJ CDs lint
12m2s: I&amp;#39;ve actually set my I think vs code by
12m4s: default I don&amp;#39;t know let me know in the
12m6s: chat VSS code by default will auto save
12m8s: after a few seconds I don&amp;#39;t like that
12m10s: because I like to be in control of what
12m12s: happens when especially with CDs watch
12m14s: as we&amp;#39;ll see so this is saying ah yeah
12m18s: okay and these are cap specific lint
12m21s: rules that we&amp;#39;ve you know uh hit upon
12m25s: warning dollar title is prefixed with a
12m26s: dollar sign that is this the rule that
12m29s: we looked at last week and also of
12m32s: course because we&amp;#39;ve sort of you know
12m33s: changed the name of this property it&amp;#39;s
12m36s: also it can and will also lint other
12m39s: file types
12m41s: EG linting CDs files here data model CDs
12m44s: and it will also lint CSV files how
12m47s: amazing is that so in fact also we can
12m48s: you know we can sort of uh what&amp;#39;s it
12m50s: called command click on control click on
12m51s: there and it will take us directly to
12m53s: the offending part of that file
12m56s: similarly here click take us to the
12m58s: directly the offending part of that file
13m0s: and of course the reason why that is no
13m2s: good anymore is because there isn&amp;#39;t a
13m4s: title property right of course if we fix
13m6s: the the actual title property by
13m9s: removing that then of course we l it
13m11s: again it goes away okay so that is that
13m14s: so um Antonio M Antonio says I don&amp;#39;t
13m16s: have that setting on good no neither do
13m19s: I
13m21s: so what I want to do
13m23s: today um is sort of
13m26s: explore um running stuff okay what do I
13m30s: mean by running stuff so
13m32s: CDs um is an all round tool you know
13m36s: both for um runtime but we&amp;#39;re not really
13m40s: talking about runtime right now we&amp;#39;re
13m41s: talking about and I&amp;#39;m going to say
13m43s: design time I&amp;#39;ve said this before I&amp;#39;m
13m44s: going to say design design time thank
13m45s: you Antonio for sharing that disable
13m48s: autosave um I&amp;#39;ve got autosave
13m51s: disabled um it&amp;#39;s a design type tool as
13m54s: well it&amp;#39;s comes in the CDs DK and of
13m58s: course the design line time tool allows
13m59s: us to say CDs ad Etc right uh dot
14m5s: d-el but it&amp;#39;s also the server okay so
14m9s: it&amp;#39;s also basically the thing that that
14m11s: fires up uh Express fires up all the CDs
14m17s: all the C runtime libraries and starts
14m19s: serving the stuff that you&amp;#39;ve defined
14m22s: okay now you may or may not have seen
14m26s: different ways that uh
14m29s: tutorials blog posts whatever describe
14m32s: saying oh yeah write this CDs and blah
14m34s: blah blah and then run it
14m37s: with run it with the following command
14m40s: so CDs run is one of those commands Okay
14m44s: CDs run will do something now we&amp;#39;re
14m47s: going to we&amp;#39;re going to stare at these
14m49s: individual log lines and make sure we
14m52s: understand all of these things during
14m53s: the course of this uh particular episode
14m57s: so don&amp;#39;t worry about you know
14m59s: all of the different log lines here we
15m2s: got to make sure we sort of you know
15m4s: have stared at them and understand what
15m5s: each one is talking about now CDs run if
15m8s: we say CDs run--
15m11s: help basically it says CDs run and this
15m14s: you&amp;#39;ll find this a lot with um with cap
15m18s: uh cap you know uh convention over
15m21s: configuration grow as you go these
15m24s: two related bits of philosophy also
15m27s: extend
15m29s: into what came I I would I would argue
15m32s: came from the uh the Pearl Community uh
15m36s: DM do what I mean you know just just do
15m38s: what you you know what I want you to do
15m41s: just do it okay so if you say CDs run it
15m45s: actually is syntactic sugar a convenient
15m49s: shortcut it desugar into I was listening
15m52s: to this fantastic
15m54s: um uh podcast uh yesterday an interview
15m57s: with Simon pton Jones you know uh
15m59s: father of hll and verse and amazing
16m4s: functional programming brain anyway
16m6s: anyway uh he he said this word you know
16m8s: this this syntax D sugars because hll is
16m10s: quite a small language sort of at its
16m12s: core but it&amp;#39;s got lots of sort of uh
16m15s: syntactic sugar around it and you know
16m17s: when when it&amp;#39;s compiled uh you know the
16m20s: syntactical sugar is you know reduced
16m22s: down to is des sugared so I just love
16m24s: that word dgar so you can almost think
16m26s: of you know CDs run Des sugaring into
16m29s: CDs serve so we can actually say CDs
16m33s: serve and it does the same thing CDs
16m34s: serve like that okay and that&amp;#39;s going to
16m37s: just pick up all of the services it can
16m40s: find now as&amp;#39;s a keyword all of the
16m42s: services it can find where is it looking
16m44s: for these Services right anybody in the
16m47s: chat can suggest where they think it&amp;#39;s
16m50s: looking for these Services one of the
16m52s: clues is here loaded model from two
16m53s: files but we&amp;#39;re going to dig into that a
16m55s: little bit more okay so put in the chat
16m57s: what you think I say the chat there they
16m58s: got the chat up here and got the chat
17m0s: down there so I don&amp;#39;t know what to look
17m1s: at I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on um so
17m5s: CDs serve now um if we look at CDs serve
17m11s: help o see we got all this stuff here
17m14s: what can we serve CDs serve who all this
17m17s: amazing stuff here CDs serve you can
17m19s: specify a service name to serve we can
17m22s: specify where we want you know from what
17m24s: models we want it to be served the
17m25s: default is asterisk all all these
17m28s: different things we we&amp;#39;re going to be
17m29s: looking at mocked we got to look at with
17m31s: mocks in memory all these different
17m33s: things over this this episode and maybe
17m36s: the next episode as well but you can see
17m38s: CDs serve CDs serve all CDs serve
17m40s: catalog service right now if we have a
17m43s: look here we&amp;#39;ve got in our and don&amp;#39;t
17m46s: worry about remembering these different
17m48s: directories for now we&amp;#39;ll come to that
17m50s: in a second but in in here we&amp;#39;ve got
17m51s: this file a CDS file called cat service
17m54s: right it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what it&amp;#39;s called
17m56s: actually because it&amp;#39;s in a certain
17m58s: directory but inside there we&amp;#39;ve got a
18m1s: service called catalog service so if we
18m3s: we can also say uh shall I tell you what
18m6s: let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s um make that should I make
18m8s: one smaller there we go let me know
18m10s: Helmut you&amp;#39;re always good at tell me
18m12s: whether it&amp;#39;s uh big or small enough let
18m13s: me know if it&amp;#39;s um uh still large enough
18m17s: to
18m18s: see good day Phil you&amp;#39;re don&amp;#39;t worry
18m21s: about arriving late you&amp;#39;re arriving in
18m23s: style um you&amp;#39;ve missed uh not really
18m26s: that much we just finished off the
18m27s: linting from last time and now we&amp;#39;re
18m30s: starting to look at how to fire up a cap
18m32s: server okay uh we looked at CDs run
18m35s: which is basically syntactic sugar CDs
18m37s: serve CDs serve all now if we say CDs
18m39s: serve banana
18m43s: right okay so what it&amp;#39;s done is it&amp;#39;s
18m47s: said okay well I&amp;#39;m loading these these
18m49s: models from you know and when when we
18m51s: say model when it says model here it
18m53s: basically means you know set of
18m54s: definitions it doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean
18m57s: model as in the word model in data model
19m0s: it loads Services as well okay um and it
19m3s: loads them from it&amp;#39;s loaded from this
19m5s: file and this file again put in the chat
19m7s: why you think it&amp;#39;s found stuff in these
19m11s: files you know where does it where does
19m14s: it know to look and what is it looking
19m16s: for but we&amp;#39;re saying here CDs serve
19m19s: banana error no such service banana okay
19m23s: now if we were to add
19m25s: service banana let&amp;#39;s just put uh I don&amp;#39;t
19m29s: know entity
19m31s: F can we can we get a key ID integer
19m35s: that&amp;#39;ll do for now um service banana I&amp;#39;m
19m39s: not sure I need a semic CO on there
19m40s: let&amp;#39;s just try try that again CDs serve
19m42s: banana there we go okay now what have we
19m46s: done there we&amp;#39;ve basically added in just
19m49s: happen to be inside this cat service
19m50s: file it doesn&amp;#39;t matter it could be in a
19m51s: separate file we&amp;#39;ve added a service
19m53s: called banana so it&amp;#39;s now said oh yeah
19m57s: okay I&amp;#39;ve found you know I&amp;#39;m loar
19m58s: loading I&amp;#39;m still loading the
19m59s: definitions from everywhere that I can
20m3s: find but you want me to only serve the
20m5s: banana service by the way I don&amp;#39;t know
20m8s: whether Joe Blow Joe Blow I think would
20m10s: remember Joe is a good friend of the uh
20m13s: uh the hands on SCP Dev family uh and he
20m15s: will remember that uh in in my previous
20m17s: Consulting days uh my my test word is
20m20s: banana so Banana is just you know the
20m22s: random word like Foo um so serving
20m26s: banana now if we have a look at that let
20m28s: open that uh let me close that one there
20m30s: and then put that back uh here so we can
20m33s: see uh let&amp;#39;s put that there so it&amp;#39;s on
20m36s: the other side there we go ah okay let&amp;#39;s
20m38s: do that shall I put that down there
20m42s: actually uh how do we do that down there
20m46s: down there that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s better okay
20m48s: so we can sort of see everything now is
20m50s: my face still at the bottom yes it is at
20m52s: the bottom so you can see that the
20m55s: service end
20m57s: point list only has the banana service
21m1s: okay if we were to say for example um
21m4s: CDs serve and then just nothing else
21m7s: which is the same as CDs serve
21m9s: all then it&amp;#39;s going to load the same
21m12s: things and serve catalog service which
21m15s: is that one and also banana now if we
21m17s: refresh this thing here we should see
21m18s: the two service endpoints okay so you
21m21s: can have multiple Services being served
21m24s: by the same cap server you can have
21m26s: multiple Services defined wherever you
21m29s: want in separate files in in the same
21m31s: file in this
21m33s: case but nobody else has put yet um
21m37s: somebody have a guess as to where the
21m40s: cap server might decide to
21m44s: look as to where to load these models
21m48s: okay so let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s have a look let&amp;#39;s
21m49s: start staring at these different log
21m52s: records okay so we have and also also
21m56s: you you may have noticed
21m58s: quite nicely I think now this is you
22m2s: know I&amp;#39;m going to make a generalized
22m4s: statement this is just DJ speaking here
22m6s: I mean you know I grew up in the
22m7s: Mainframe days I you know my
22m10s: first job after University
22m13s: was running sap R2 systems on IBM
22m17s: mainframes
22m18s: where it was just the most
22m20s: amazing environment in terms of the
22m22s: operating system and error messages and
22m24s: the way they were documented and every
22m26s: error message had an ID and severity and
22m28s: you could go and look it up in these
22m29s: huge manuals and everything it&amp;#39;s not the
22m31s: same now it&amp;#39;ll never be as good but one
22m35s: thing I do like about this is that we
22m38s: have these sort of little prefixes these
22m40s: little sort of contexts so you can see
22m43s: that actually there are different
22m45s: components to the cap server the thing
22m47s: that you start up with CDs run or CDs
22m49s: serve we haven&amp;#39;t done CDs watch yet
22m51s: we&amp;#39;ll do that in a minute um that uh
22m54s: then you can sort of you know increase
22m57s: or decrease increase the the verbosity
22m59s: of the logging so we could say for
23m1s: example um I think debug o bug equals
23m5s: CDs Now that uh CDs Ser that um
23m11s: uh Deb equals c um actually there&amp;#39;s a
23m15s: different way of there&amp;#39;s a different way
23m17s: of doing it um there we go there&amp;#39;s all
23m20s: sorts of De all yeah okay let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s
23m23s: get into debugging later but you can
23m25s: sort of increase Theos of all these
23m26s: different things so there for examp
23m27s: example you can see uh there&amp;#39;s another
23m30s: sort of component in the server that&amp;#39;s
23m32s: now you know suddenly logging because
23m33s: we&amp;#39;ve turned debug on why is it so warm
23m35s: in here uh because we turned debug on um
23m39s: and there&amp;#39;s another component the trace
23m41s: component and what else have we got here
23m42s: anything else of Interest here CDs
23m44s: service Factory oh my goodness what is
23m46s: that um you know all these different
23m48s: things SQL component so you know we
23m51s: could do a whole episode on you know
23m54s: looking at how we can help ourselves to
23m57s: find out what what&amp;#39;s going on
23m59s: but for now let&amp;#39;s just run CDs serve
24m2s: like that so it&amp;#39;s loaded these models
24m5s: loaded definitions from two files serve
24m7s: cat service and DB data model now notice
24m9s: something that Antonio said models go
24m10s: under the DB folder right and services
24m12s: on serve folder any mock data under DB
24m14s: data perfect so Antony has a great
24m17s: start now convention over configuration
24m20s: but there is configuration that sort of
24m23s: determines what Antonio has just
24m26s: said so let me make this a little bit
24m29s: bigger in fact I think you can oh never
24m31s: mind I&amp;#39;ll just do it that okay um let me
24m33s: make that there now CDs EnV I think we
24m38s: touched on this last time didn&amp;#39;t we CDs
24m40s: EnV will give
24m42s: us
24m44s: the what&amp;#39;s the word I&amp;#39;m looking for the
24m47s: uh the calculated the the effective
24m49s: environment configuration there&amp;#39;s all
24m51s: sorts of
24m52s: settings that have default values
24m56s: Convention of configuration really
24m58s: important but also things that you can
25m1s: change so if we say CDs EnV it will give
25m4s: us a ton of information now we don&amp;#39;t
25m7s: want to look through all this different
25m9s: stuff here but what we can say for
25m11s: example is and this is this is I think
25m13s: yeah when we when we looked last time we
25m15s: looked at the value of this special sort
25m17s: of environment variable or the CDs
25m20s: environment CDs environment variable
25m22s: uncore homecore CDs DK which is the
25m24s: location of the actual CDs development
25m26s: kit that&amp;#39;s where we found to look for
25m29s: files when we were trying to figure out
25m30s: where Jane air came from right uh Lu
25m33s: good morning amazing live
25m35s: congratulations congratulations to
25m36s: everybody here for joining and being a
25m38s: part of the team
25m40s: so uh so we got cdsn now if we say
25m44s: cdsn
25m46s: get okay the cdsn get that&amp;#39;s just to
25m49s: help help you get help with everything
25m51s: okay you can do all sorts of different
25m53s: things here if we say cdsn get and I&amp;#39;m
25m56s: going to just do one folders
25m58s: right folders bear with me check it out
26m2s: check it out you can also say say
26m4s: cdsn list folders you get like different
26m6s: sort of properties format output okay so
26m10s: you know choose your poison I quite like
26m12s: cdsn get because actually when it knows
26m15s: it&amp;#39;s emiting to a terminal it&amp;#39;s going to
26m17s: sort of you know put in a a sort of a
26m19s: human readable style bit of Json it&amp;#39;s
26m22s: not really Jason but if you pipe it if
26m24s: it&amp;#39;s not in the context of a
26m25s: terminal it&amp;#39;s actually Jason which is
26m28s: really cool so let&amp;#39;s stare at that for a
26m30s: second cdsn get folders these are the
26m34s: default folders that the cap server will
26m38s: look
26m39s: in when it&amp;#39;s starting up it will look in
26m42s: these folders and it just so happens of
26m45s: course you know it makes sense to have
26m46s: the defaults to be the same name as the
26m47s: folder names you know the same name as
26m49s: the sort of semantic names here let&amp;#39;s
26m51s: call them DB Ser an app right remember
26m55s: as Antonio said as well DB is way you
26m57s: Define your data models as in your lower
26m59s: you know persistence layer stuff serve
27m1s: is where you define your services and
27m3s: app is where you can put you know sort
27m5s: of you know front end you know human
27m7s: facing you know HTML 5 things okay front
27m13s: ends however you don&amp;#39;t have to do it
27m15s: like that okay and one of the beauties
27m16s: of CDs the language and one of the
27m19s: beauties of cap is that you can mix and
27m22s: match and Define what where how whatever
27m27s: you want okay so we&amp;#39;re going to explore
27m28s: that a little bit now there&amp;#39;s also as
27m31s: well as these this
27m34s: folders um property you can also
27m38s: say Roots okay this is like a
27m41s: geta and this will combine the values of
27m46s: the
27m47s: folders with two sort of fixed hardcoded
27m53s: names for
27m55s: files okay so we could could say for
27m57s: example I be crazy to say but we could
27m59s: say we could say CDs config we could
28m1s: there&amp;#39;s all different ways
28m3s: of effect affecting this CDs effective
28m8s: environment the effective configuration
28m10s: so we could say CDs config uh equals
28m14s: let&amp;#39;s say
28m15s: um fold you have to specify obviously
28m19s: folders uh like that and then we could
28m21s: say here DB the DB folder um actually or
28m27s: the DB the semantic folder is in a
28m29s: folder called um Apple you know on the
28m33s: fruit banana thing Apple like that right
28m36s: let&amp;#39;s see what happens there when we do
28m37s: that uh let&amp;#39;s close that close that
28m39s: close that CDs and get
28m45s: folders so now we are setting on the fly
28m48s: through the setting of a value for this
28m51s: CDs config special environment variable
28m53s: we&amp;#39;re sort of overriding the default
28m56s: value for the DB semantic folder okay so
29m1s: now we could say C we see what happens I
29m4s: don&amp;#39;t know see what happens CDs run or
29m6s: serve
29m7s: serve it&amp;#39;s also ah okay it&amp;#39;s folders DB
29m12s: Apple but it&amp;#39;s also looking in DB
29m14s: because the effective configuration also
29m16s: includes DB
29m19s: now instead of putting things in these
29m23s: different um
29m25s: directories let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s go back
29m28s: and start from scratch and have nothing
29m30s: okay so what we do is go into here let&amp;#39;s
29m33s: close everything close
29m36s: all and say remove uh
29m40s: all Bookshop
29m43s: right blast everything away so we got
29m46s: nothing at the moment apart from Dev
29m47s: container
29m49s: now why don&amp;#39;t we say
29m51s: CDs um in
29m54s: it uh simple okay we won&amp;#39;t add the tiny
29m59s: sample so we&amp;#39;ll say CDs in it
30m2s: simple now go into simple and what have
30m5s: we got in fact I&amp;#39;d like to you know
30m8s: tree there we go what we&amp;#39;ve got is the
30m11s: simplest thing that could possibly work
30m13s: is it no it&amp;#39;s not right we could
30m15s: actually remove remove rmd app BB and
30m20s: serf now all we&amp;#39;ve got is
30m23s: literally all right we got some helper
30m25s: files here in fact let tree just it
30m27s: minus a to see all of the yeah there we
30m29s: go that&amp;#39;s better I think this is much
30m30s: nicer display than that okay so anyway
30m32s: so what we&amp;#39;ve got is what we looked at
30m35s: on episode one CDs RC es lint RC get
30m38s: ignore we know what they are so we can
30m39s: sort of discount those read me a little
30m41s: bit of you know markdown documentation
30m43s: file fine vs. vs code that&amp;#39;s the sort of
30m47s: vs code specific helper files to you
30m49s: know do cool things with vs code and cap
30m52s: but apart from that we have nothing all
30m54s: we&amp;#39;ve the most important file what we
30m56s: got here
30m57s: is the package Json okay so what happens
31m2s: if we say CDs serve now oops
31m7s: CDs
31m9s: serve error couldn&amp;#39;t find a CDS model
31m12s: for
31m15s: asterisk in workspaces cap to be made
31m19s: simple
31m21s: now this is where in order to resolve
31m24s: this I would like with you to move on
31m27s: from CDs serve to CU I&amp;#39;m running CDs
31m30s: serve each time CDs run CDs serve all
31m34s: it&amp;#39;s going to make no difference because
31m36s: there&amp;#39;s nothing there we you know we
31m38s: didn&amp;#39;t have sign tiny sample we haven&amp;#39;t
31m40s: even got a DB folder an app folder a
31m44s: serve folder nothing but remember cdsn
31m49s: getet
31m51s: Roots we have the possibility of putting
31m55s: things in folders with these n or for
31m58s: example putting something in a file
32m1s: called schema. CDs or services. CDs okay
32m7s: so one of the really cool things about
32m11s: cap and CDs in general in the node.js
32m15s: environment in this particular case but
32m16s: also in a similar way in the Java
32m18s: environment is that the development
32m22s: cycle for others developers is so tight
32m25s: and designed to be as helpful as we oh
32m29s: you can hear the bird Shing excellent
32m30s: yes div to be as helpful to you as a
32m32s: developer in the design time figuring
32m34s: out things bashing your head against the
32m36s: wall what&amp;#39;s going on here let me try and
32m37s: change this etc etc as possible and for
32m42s: that we have CDs watch now if we say CDs
32m47s: watch help so we got we got CDs run go
32m51s: and run the stuff which is syntactic
32m52s: sugar for CDs serve go and serve the
32m54s: stuff and we&amp;#39;ve seen that CDs serve he&amp;#39;s
32m57s: going to say well there&amp;#39;s nothing to
32m58s: serve and then goes
33m1s: bang so think of CDs run or CDs serve
33m5s: more specifically I suppose as a as a as
33m8s: a more of a
33m9s: runtime
33m11s: invocation but we&amp;#39;re in design time
33m13s: we&amp;#39;re still developing right we haven&amp;#39;t
33m14s: developed anything yet and for design
33m18s: time we have another command in our CDs
33m22s: Arsenal called CDs
33m24s: watch and if we say CD watch help we got
33m27s: a ton of stuff but if we scroll
33m31s: up let&amp;#39;s just read this okay tell CDs to
33m36s: watch for Relevant things to come or
33m38s: change in the specified project okay by
33m40s: default it&amp;#39;s you know the direct true in
33m43s: or the current word
33m44s: directory compiles and reruns the server
33m48s: on every change
33m51s: detected Phil KY says maybe a future
33m54s: session DJ would be to cover Java cap I
33m55s: know it&amp;#39;s not used as much but some
33m57s: projects I&amp;#39;m working on have required
33m58s: knowledge of java cap so Phil I think
34m2s: um either the previous episode or the
34m4s: previous to that one um this also came
34m6s: up I&amp;#39;m not a Java person but I do know
34m9s: some awesome Java people in the cap team
34m11s: here at sap so what I&amp;#39;d said was once we
34m13s: sort of get through you know this Back
34m16s: to Basics with cap no. JS we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll
34m18s: hopefully get some Java people on and
34m20s: we&amp;#39;ll do a bit of that How would how
34m21s: would that work um I hopefully that that
34m24s: be okay ah good morning cier good
34m26s: morning special
34m28s: than great welcome so time 8:33 so
34m33s: compiles and reruns a server on every
34m35s: change detected amazing so if anybody
34m38s: has used you know a live reload facility
34m41s: there&amp;#39;s one in nodejs that was created
34m43s: by Remy sharp I can&amp;#39;t remember what it&amp;#39;s
34m45s: called is it called live reload I can&amp;#39;t
34m47s: remember uh anyway it&amp;#39;s a similar sort
34m49s: of thing but better so actually CDs
34m52s: watch is just a convenient shortcut for
34m56s: CDs server all with Mock and in memory
35m0s: now we&amp;#39;re going to maybe look at with
35m1s: Mock and in memory later on when we
35m4s: start staring at all the different log
35m5s: output to understand what they
35m7s: do no worries Phil thank you for asking
35m10s: brilliant keep your questions coming any
35m12s: question any question I might not be
35m13s: able to answer it but there we go so
35m16s: what we&amp;#39;ll say is CDS
35m20s: watch and remember we&amp;#39;ve got in fact
35m23s: let&amp;#39;s have let&amp;#39;s have another terminal
35m27s: down
35m29s: here H there
35m32s: right remember that we&amp;#39;ve got basically
35m36s: no CDs definitions whatsoever we haven&amp;#39;t
35m38s: even got a DB server or app directories
35m43s: right so CDs watch let&amp;#39;s see what
35m45s: happens in fact let&amp;#39;s get don&amp;#39;t need
35m46s: that
35m49s: enter oh look at that
35m52s: now I love this because it&amp;#39;s sort of
35m56s: allows us to stop and stare and think
35m59s: about what the heck is going on so first
36m1s: of all it says this is actually what I&amp;#39;m
36m3s: doing for you CDs serve all with mock in
36m5s: memory question mark which is what the
36m6s: help told us it was doing and it&amp;#39;ll set
36m10s: up a live you know if we were in a
36m12s: certain um you know browser um URL here
36m16s: it would it would do that however
36m18s: nothing&amp;#39;s being served so this is going
36m19s: to sort of spin for a while so we stop
36m21s: that now okay thank you chika uh sorry
36m26s: uh chakia thank you chakia exactly it&amp;#39;s
36m28s: noemon well remembered good call there
36m31s: good call so um that&amp;#39;s the one that&amp;#39;s
36m34s: the uh the mechanism from Remy
36m38s: sharp I think originally the
36m40s: cap project was using
36m43s: nodemon um when they first came up with
36m45s: this brilliant idea of uh you know
36m47s: having this really tight development
36m48s: cycle anyway no models found in DB serve
36m53s: app schema or services so now we&amp;#39;ve
36m55s: looked at we&amp;#39;ll open another terminal
36m59s: see I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m still not used to sort of
37m0s: using vs code it&amp;#39;s just like too
37m2s: complicated for me um if we say CD now
37m4s: we looked at cdsn let&amp;#39;s do LS for a
37m7s: change LS
37m9s: Roots right we Now understand what the
37m13s: heck that means right we know that it&amp;#39;s
37m16s: looking for things where is it looking
37m18s: for things it&amp;#39;s looking for things
37m20s: defined in this
37m22s: Roots um property and The Roots property
37m25s: as we know is made up of a hardcoded
37m29s: word schema and a hard-coded word
37m31s: Services which is then you know the
37m32s: final name services. CDs and schema. CDs
37m36s: plus the values for these folders which
37m39s: we can change but anyway let&amp;#39;s not go
37m40s: into that but we got rid of the folders
37m43s: and we don&amp;#39;t have anything so if we were
37m44s: to say touch which is basically in you
37m47s: know in any normal operating system
37m49s: will&amp;#39;ll create a file touch um banana.
37m53s: CDs okay now oh I&amp;#39;m in the wrong
37m57s: directory hold on uh remove banana. CDs
38m0s: go into simple there we go uh and let&amp;#39;s
38m3s: just show you that CDs and F the folders
38m5s: are the same you know it&amp;#39;s configuration
38m7s: in this directory in in our project
38m8s: directory it&amp;#39;s the same so if you say
38m11s: touch banana CDs oh by the way I&amp;#39;ve just
38m13s: noticed Luis says DJ just confirm you
38m15s: have removed the Bookshop project and
38m17s: started a new project under the name
38m18s: simple yes exactly thank you for
38m20s: pointing out l in fact i&amp;#39; forgot myself
38m22s: right so you know I need to move it oh
38m25s: tell you what
38m28s: rather than each Ah that&amp;#39;s a good point
38m30s: instead of doing that let&amp;#39;s go into
38m35s: here let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s blast away that project
38m37s: as well and let&amp;#39;s create a cap project
38m41s: in this cap B2B main you know in the
38m43s: main directory so all we have to do is
38m45s: CDs in it and not give a project name so
38m49s: it won&amp;#39;t create a separate new directory
38m51s: CDs in it bang creating new cap project
38m54s: in current folder add adding feature no
38m57s: J we didn&amp;#39;t specify anything else to add
38m59s: with a D- add so all it&amp;#39;s done is done
39m1s: the default which if you don&amp;#39;t specify
39m3s: the runtime it&amp;#39;s going to pick no JS as
39m5s: default go and find that in the cdsd K
39m8s: source code it&amp;#39;s you know it&amp;#39;s quite
39m10s: easy to find so there we go okay so
39m12s: actually L
39m14s: um uh yes that was the case now I&amp;#39;ve
39m16s: removed the Bookshop and started a new
39m17s: project under the name simple now I&amp;#39;ve
39m19s: started a new project in this current
39m21s: directory instead keep to keep it simple
39m23s: so when I change and you know when I
39m24s: create a new um what&amp;#39;s it called a new
39m26s: new um terminal I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m already in the
39m29s: right directory okay so let&amp;#39;s do CDs
39m32s: watch okay and if I say touch banana.
39m35s: CDs what&amp;#39;s going to happen what do you
39m37s: think is going to
39m42s: happen what
39m44s: happened CDs watch the part of CDs watch
39m50s: that watches
39m51s: for changes and additions to content in
39m55s: the project Direct in the current
39m57s: working
39m58s: directory
40m0s: noticed that&amp;#39;s not you say noticed that
40m4s: oh R RF app RM rmd let&amp;#39;s remove app DB
40m10s: and the reason I&amp;#39;m using rmd instead of
40m12s: RM minus RF is to sort of prove to you
40m14s: that there&amp;#39;s nothing in these
40m16s: directories right if you tried to do an
40m17s: rmd of a directory and it had stuff in
40m20s: it it would say uh but these directories
40m22s: are empty and we can prove that by
40m23s: saying remove them there we go tree
40m25s: there right so all we&amp;#39;ve got is package
40m28s: Jason read me and banana. CDs touch
40m31s: banana touch banana yes um so um we got
40m36s: nothing in banana cat banana uh cat
40m39s: banana. CDs nothing in there but it
40m42s: noticed that there&amp;#39;s a new file but this
40m45s: new file even though it&amp;#39;s a CDS file
40m47s: with a CDS extension is not in the
40m51s: either in the list of directories it&amp;#39;s
40m53s: looking at nor is it called schema . CDs
40m57s: or services.
40m58s: CDs so why don&amp;#39;t we say time perfect why
41m1s: don&amp;#39;t we say move banana. CDs to
41m6s: services. CDs what what you think is
41m8s: going to
41m12s: happen now let&amp;#39;s move this down a
41m16s: bit so we were
41m19s: there and then it said oh my goodness me
41m23s: I found something loaded model from one
41m25s: file so services. CDs remember before we
41m28s: you know we saw this loaded model from
41m30s: two files serve SL catalog service. CDs
41m34s: and dbd model CDs right that&amp;#39;s a result
41m38s: of it looking in the roots in DB serve
41m41s: app and looking for any files called
41m42s: schema. CDs and service. CDs there&amp;#39;s
41m44s: also a special file called index. CDs
41m47s: which we&amp;#39;ll talk about another time
41m49s: that&amp;#39;s almost like a bit of an
41m50s: index.html in the old Apache uh httpd
41m54s: days where if it finds an index index
41m57s: file it will sort of show that in fact
42m0s: there Al that that tradition is also
42m3s: extent here in cap because if it finds
42m6s: an index.html file in the app directory
42m9s: it will serve that instead of serving
42m12s: the default this in fact um
42m16s: yeah let&amp;#39;s should we do digress on that
42m20s: one if we now okay here we go yeah Local
42m22s: Host let&amp;#39;s open Local Host Here Local
42m25s: Host 404
42m27s: yeah this even this tells us something
42m29s: right even this tells us
42m32s: something these are the paths currently
42m34s: serve web locations nonone service
42m35s: endpoints nonone right and this is the
42m38s: default sort of you know helper helper
42m41s: HTML that you get however right if we
42m44s: were Daniel what touch banana if we were
42m48s: um to say uh touch index. HT oh sorry
42m52s: make
42m53s: the make DJ less more haste less speed
42m57s: make dear app and
43m1s: touchapp
43m6s: index.html now we&amp;#39;ve got of course it&amp;#39;s
43m9s: not going to it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not looking in
43m10s: the app folder here so let&amp;#39;s just do
43m11s: that and do that again CDs
43m14s: watch now look at that in fact cat into
43m18s: app
43m19s: index.html H1 banana
43m24s: H1 and then refresh that there we go
43m27s: there we go so
43m28s: basically you can control what comes out
43m31s: of the the default cap server by putting
43m35s: stuff in the app directory specifically
43m37s: index HTML and everything flows from
43m38s: there anyway that was a bit of a stupid
43m40s: digression um but that makes sense RM
43m43s: minus RF app so I do need to do RM minus
43m46s: RF because there&amp;#39;s something in app now
43m47s: get rid of that get rid of that press
43m50s: refresh and now we back to there but we
43m52s: still got nothing served right we still
43m54s: got nothing served we get a different
43m55s: message
43m56s: loaded model from on file services. CDs
43m59s: let&amp;#39;s open let&amp;#39;s open Services code
44m1s: services. CDs it&amp;#39;s there uh
44m5s: oh that&amp;#39;ll do actually yeah that&amp;#39;ll do
44m9s: um but it says no service definitions
44m13s: found in loaded
44m15s: models so it&amp;#39;s loaded some models from
44m19s: here but there are no service
44m21s: definitions found waiting for some to
44m23s: arrive so why don&amp;#39;t we give it one right
44m28s: now here&amp;#39;s a brilliant opportunity for
44m31s: us to sort of reconnect our brains with
44m34s: the um the cap documentation so let&amp;#39;s go
44m38s: there um Chrome new new Chrome put that
44m41s: there
44m42s: cap there now if we go to get
44m48s: started in episode one we went through
44m52s: all this stuff here did we no we went we
44m53s: went on the prel did we prelim there it
44m56s: is jump starter project yeah we&amp;#39;ve done
44m58s: that CDs watch um and we also did the
45m1s: where is
45m3s: it we did the jump start project jump
45m7s: start guide jump start yeah here we go
45m9s: we&amp;#39;ve done this we&amp;#39;ve done the setup
45m10s: okay so that&amp;#39;s where we are but what I
45m11s: want to show you is this hello
45m14s: world amazing right let&amp;#39;s create a
45m17s: simple hello world o data right going
45m18s: from Zero to Hero in about two seconds
45m21s: oh so Rohan hello R CDs run CDs serve
45m24s: CDs watch to be found in sap CDs I how
45m26s: would we know where to find Declaration
45m27s: of these commands functions in case some
45m29s: versions don&amp;#39;t have brilliant question
45m31s: Rohan thank you for asking that question
45m33s: that&amp;#39;s a really good
45m34s: question think of it in this way that
45m38s: CDs run is just syntactic isn&amp;#39;t so let&amp;#39;s
45m41s: ignore CDs run for now CDs serve
45m44s: basically starts the services starts
45m46s: serving all the CDs definitions you&amp;#39;ve
45m49s: got
45m51s: okay so that is valid for design time
45m55s: but it&amp;#39;s also valid for run
45m57s: time
45m59s: okay would you want for example um a
46m3s: linting tool in production would you
46m5s: want a tool that would do command
46m8s: completion for you in production would
46m10s: you want something that I can&amp;#39;t think of
46m12s: anything else but would you want
46m14s: something would you want some code that
46m16s: automatically look for changes to files
46m19s: and restarted the server would you want
46m21s: that in production no so we can sort of
46m23s: see the dividing line between the these
46m26s: three commands for example CDs run CDs
46m28s: serve and CDs watch CDs watch is not
46m31s: part of sap CDs it&amp;#39;s part of sap CDs DK
46m36s: it&amp;#39;s part of the development kit it&amp;#39;s
46m38s: not part of the runtime okay remember if
46m42s: we say here um where are we uh let&amp;#39;s
46m45s: open another one of these CDs V CDs
46m48s: version so CDs watch is part
46m51s: of this it&amp;#39;s not part of this
46m56s: okay so if you look in the actual node
46m59s: modules and all the files and everything
47m1s: you won&amp;#39;t find a CDS watch or you know
47m3s: it&amp;#39;s actually watch. JS and watched. JS
47m6s: because it&amp;#39;s split it out for various
47m8s: asynchronous
47m9s: reasons it&amp;#39;s not in there it&amp;#39;s in there
47m11s: does that makes sense Rohan it&amp;#39;s a great
47m13s: question and it&amp;#39;s also really important
47m14s: to help us understand the difference
47m16s: between design time and run time and the
47m18s: tools we need for design time and the
47m19s: tools we need for run time we got to
47m20s: think as well about you know running
47m23s: things in the cloud and you know having
47m25s: the minimum surface area of code for
47m28s: security reasons you know and so on and
47m30s: you know it&amp;#39;s always a little more
47m31s: Compact and you know quicker etc etc
47m33s: it&amp;#39;s all part of the same sort of story
47m35s: brilliant question now I&amp;#39;ve completely
47m37s: forgotten what I was about to do uh not
47m39s: your fault Rohan at all it&amp;#39;s just I&amp;#39;ve
47m41s: got a brain the size of a gfish uh
47m44s: waiting for model to oh services oh yes
47m46s: that&amp;#39;s right yes so um we were looking
47m50s: here going from Zero to Hero so let&amp;#39;s
47m54s: define a c service and let def find a
47m57s: function now this is I love and I do
48m0s: find this a little bit strange as like a
48m3s: hello world but is a brilliant hello
48m4s: world because not everything is sort of
48m6s: odata shaped in the sort of the the
48m8s: nonorthogonal odata style you know I
48m10s: always think of functions and and
48m13s: actions in odata you know those are two
48m14s: OD V4 things are sort of orthogonal to
48m17s: the purity of odata which is sort of
48m19s: restful these are this you know a
48m21s: function and an action even more so in
48m24s: my humble opinion are not restful
48m27s: they&amp;#39;re sort of orthogonal to the whole
48m29s: restful style of what odor is which is
48m31s: you know a small number of verb a small
48m33s: number of nouns sorry small number of
48m34s: verbs get put post delete or the O dat
48m36s: operations you know create read update
48m38s: delete and query and an infinite number
48m40s: of verbs I.E the URLs The Entity sets
48m42s: the entities whatever functions action
48m44s: are different however I think it&amp;#39;s still
48m46s: pretty cool to start with this because
48m49s: why not right and also we can have some
48m51s: fun with it so why don&amp;#39;t we say uh in
48m54s: here o hello 848 uh so we say um
48m58s: service um well let let&amp;#39;s do this so we
49m1s: can we so we can go back to this later
49m3s: service say what does it say here
49m4s: service
49m5s: say there let&amp;#39;s just save that first of
49m8s: all oh my goodness right we got nothing
49m9s: in the service
49m10s: say in fact we don&amp;#39;t even know you know
49m12s: we don&amp;#39;t even know uh don&amp;#39;t even need
49m15s: that&amp;#39;s crazy right service say do we
49m17s: need that we need that right because
49m18s: it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s actually even telling us we
49m20s: need that it&amp;#39;s got a fantastic sort of a
49m22s: syntax thing my brain&amp;#39;s not working m
49m25s: end of file I&amp;#39;m expecting something else
49m28s: right so give me something else there we
49m29s: go there&amp;#39;s our sort of you know the body
49m31s: of our service definition let&amp;#39;s save
49m33s: that and we we now see that for example
49m37s: loading model from one file okay oh now
49m39s: now it&amp;#39;s worth doing something so we&amp;#39;re
49m41s: going to do some we&amp;#39;ll look into these
49m43s: next time
49m45s: uh I&amp;#39;m in Poland next week so maybe it
49m48s: be a week after but anyway next
49m50s: time but look at that serving say
49m54s: serving the service call say that it&amp;#39;s
49m56s: found in this default Services file if I
49m59s: were to again just to just rub this in
50m2s: to drive this home if I were to say move
50m5s: services to nothing. CDs right that&amp;#39;s
50m10s: going to restart and say no models found
50m12s: okay so let&amp;#39;s move it back again move
50m14s: nothing to
50m15s: services. CDs and it&amp;#39;s now restarted and
50m19s: we&amp;#39;re back again okay so now and look at
50m21s: that it&amp;#39;s refreshed reload you know
50m24s: amazing don&amp;#39;t leave finger developers
50m27s: cap loves developers cap loves
50m29s: developers right there we have our
50m31s: service endpoint odata V4 say why is
50m35s: what&amp;#39;s going on we haven&amp;#39;t said anything
50m36s: about OD data why does it say OD data V4
50m39s: say and why is there a Dollar metad data
50m41s: there right can somebody tell me time is
50m44s: 8:49 perfect we got time fors to pause
50m47s: because I know there&amp;#39;s about 20 seconds
50m48s: delay why do we get this service
50m53s: endpoint that&amp;#39;s slod data/ B4 SL say
50m57s: let&amp;#39;s have a look at it okay look at
50m59s: that amazing uh an error occurred while
51m1s: serializing the service document cannot
51m3s: read properties of null one of the
51m6s: Fantastic things is that you can break
51m9s: nothing nothing can go wrong in a
51m12s: disastrous sense all these error
51m14s: messages tell us something and help us
51m16s: learn about cap and about CDs and about
51m19s: o data for that
51m21s: matter what this is saying is it&amp;#39;s
51m24s: trying to serve us go there look he&amp;#39;s
51m26s: trying to serve us a service
51m28s: document remember o data you know we&amp;#39;re
51m31s: still trying to answer the question in
51m33s: the chat please somebody why does it
51m36s: give us SL oata V4 as a prefix you know
51m38s: why is it OD
51m40s: data I mean you know it&amp;#39;s a simple
51m41s: answer but let&amp;#39;s just talk about it
51m44s: explicitly so because it&amp;#39;s trying to
51m47s: serve this as OD data this is our
51m50s: service document an O data service
51m51s: document basically as a list of entities
51m54s: but we we we&amp;#39;ve done the most
51m56s: ridiculously stupid thing here and
51m58s: Define nothing right we&amp;#39;ve defined
52m0s: nothing there&amp;#39;s no entities no
52m3s: nothing so it can&amp;#39;t give
52m6s: us you know a a representation of the
52m9s: entity because there aren&amp;#39;t any okay now
52m12s: if we were to go back and look at the
52m15s: metadata document there are two
52m16s: well-known documents in O data there the
52m18s: service document which is looked just
52m19s: looked at which which the cap server has
52m21s: sort of failed to be able to create for
52m23s: us because you know how can it and
52m25s: there&amp;#39;s a meadas document which is like
52m27s: you know the minimum thing ever right um
52m31s: so I can see somebody&amp;#39;s uh CH uh chica
52m34s: has put something I I won&amp;#39;t I won&amp;#39;t read
52m35s: that there I&amp;#39;ll look at in a second
52m38s: hopefully it&amp;#39;s the answer um so we can
52m40s: see here may that big
52m41s: bigger can see
52m44s: here that we get an OD data metadata
52m47s: document it&amp;#39;s a version OD dat V4 and we
52m50s: have basically a schema with a name
52m54s: space safe there&amp;#39;s no nothing in it
52m56s: right but it&amp;#39;s still valid metadata now
52m59s: if we oh so so chica says cap exposes
53m2s: protocol as default path exactly so just
53m7s: as for example um CDs in it will default
53m12s: to node.js because you know let&amp;#39;s have a
53m14s: default um
53m17s: also I think it&amp;#39;s fair to say that you
53m19s: know
53m20s: cap was designed
53m24s: primarily to be this amazing and it is
53m28s: uh way to create OD dat services like
53m32s: that it can also do other things you
53m33s: know um but by default it will serve o
53m36s: data and since uh CDs version
53m41s: 7 right it will prefix the OD dat
53m45s: services with slod data V4 so you can
53m47s: have different style so for example here
53m50s: let&amp;#39;s do this oh oh yes that&amp;#39;s be big we
53m53s: could say at rest we could say let&amp;#39;s
53m58s: annotate this service with the rest at
54m2s: rest
54m3s: annotation and now what happens loaded
54m5s: model from file Services blah blah blah
54m8s: blah blah serving say path SLR SL say so
54m13s: all of a sudden we&amp;#39;re not serving a o
54m15s: data service anymore we&amp;#39;re serving like
54m16s: a you know a more generic
54m20s: restful API rest say what happens bang
54m24s: nothing no entities right right you know
54m26s: what else could it do right
54m29s: anyway I think one of the one of the
54m31s: takeaways and OD data is the default
54m33s: exactly exactly ch ch one of the one of
54m35s: the takeaways hopefully you&amp;#39;re taking
54m37s: away from this um ramble is that you
54m41s: should experiment because the cap server
54m44s: and this this environment is just
54m46s: begging for you to find out by trying
54m49s: learning by doing right anyway let&amp;#39;s
54m51s: let&amp;#39;s get rid of that um uh annotation
54m54s: let&amp;#39;s get back to the O data service and
54m56s: now let&amp;#39;s finally add this other bit
54m58s: here which is basically adding a
55m0s: function definition let just copy paste
55m2s: that bit quicker right let&amp;#39;s go here add
55m5s: that bang bang
55m8s: save so
55m12s: now we&amp;#39;ve got this function let&amp;#39;s have a
55m14s: look at the
55m15s: metadata entity container it&amp;#39;s got an
55m18s: entity container and it&amp;#39;s got a function
55m20s: import okay this is one of these new OD
55m21s: dat function Imports um can anybody tell
55m24s: me difference between a function and an
55m26s: action in O data okay I&amp;#39;ll give you a
55m29s: bit of a clue in fact this documentation
55m31s: is going to give us a bit of a
55m34s: clue I&amp;#39;ll just jump down to run it so
55m37s: we&amp;#39;re already running CDs watch and if
55m39s: we go to Local Host OD data V4 say hello
55m43s: to equals World which is basically
55m44s: invoking that function let&amp;#39;s just copy
55m46s: that link address let&amp;#39;s go back to this
55m47s: page here instead let&amp;#39;s open up a tab
55m50s: and do that what do you think is going
55m52s: to
55m52s: happen what do you think is going to to
56m0s: happen
56m2s: nice we got to here there was our
56m8s: get for the metadata and then this line
56m13s: here from the OD data component yeah
56m16s: there&amp;#39;s a log OD data loging right it
56m19s: says oh okay I&amp;#39;m about I&amp;#39;ve just been
56m22s: I&amp;#39;ve just received a request for this
56m24s: URL o V4 say hello 2 equals world
56m28s: now if anybody
56m31s: remembers oh Nico says actions modify
56m34s: data functions don&amp;#39;t what a beautifully
56m36s: succinct way of saying it and that&amp;#39;s
56m39s: exactly correct okay so actions may have
56m44s: side effects as in data gets modified on
56m47s: the server
56m48s: right functions may not have side
56m52s: effects and the implication of that in
56m56s: this restful context we&amp;#39;re going a bit
56m58s: off piece with o days now but anyway is
57m2s: that you shouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed you can&amp;#39;t
57m6s: and cap won&amp;#39;t allow you to make a call
57m10s: to an
57m12s: action with the htdp method get because
57m16s: get
57m18s: implies uh no side effects and
57m21s: idempotent idempotency okay um
57m25s: I&amp;#39;ll put some links in the description
57m27s: for this one um you know when I go
57m30s: through it and you know write it up and
57m31s: everything to those different things but
57m33s: basically you should be able to call a
57m36s: function with get you can&amp;#39;t call an
57m39s: action with get you have to use post
57m42s: because using the word the the the htb
57m45s: method post implies semantically that
57m49s: you are ready for expecting
57m53s: wanting you&amp;#39;re going into a contract
57m56s: with the server that may or may not
57m59s: bring about a side effect a change in
58m1s: data that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the semantics of
58m5s: post similar to put but you know let&amp;#39;s
58m8s: not go there so the fact that it&amp;#39;s
58m10s: trying to handle this
58m13s: request tells us that it&amp;#39;s a function
58m16s: okay tells us that there&amp;#39;s no side
58m17s: effects tells us that cap is doing the
58m19s: right thing because we&amp;#39;ve defined it as
58m21s: a function rather than an action if we
58m23s: want to Define an action
58m27s: there we do that and in fact I don&amp;#39;t
58m29s: think that was going to work yeah um
58m31s: hello to we need a bit more with the
58m33s: action but anyway let&amp;#39;s get rid of that
58m34s: there save that there we go fine done
58m37s: now the error that we
58m42s: get is service say has no Handler for
58m48s: hello now let&amp;#39;s add a Handler in fact
58m51s: the documentation says add a Handler
58m54s: there we goes do that now the
58m56s: documentation says here create a file
58m58s: called world. JS in the same directory
59m1s: as world. CDs again convention get can
59m4s: have a payload generally in od data I&amp;#39;m
59m9s: pretty sure that&amp;#39;s a great that&amp;#39;s a
59m11s: great question carer I&amp;#39;m pretty sure
59m13s: there are no circumstances that I&amp;#39;ve
59m15s: ever come across where you would make a
59m19s: get request as in you would make what
59m22s: does get translate into or what does
59m23s: what do OD dat oper what are the O data
59m25s: operations that translate into the HTTP
59m27s: method get they are um uh read and query
59m32s: there are no circumstances that I can
59m34s: think of at all in od data where a read
59m36s: or a query operation would require you
59m38s: to send any information in the body of
59m41s: the HTTP request so the answer basically
59m44s: is well technically it
59m46s: can but no it doesn&amp;#39;t Kristoff um I mean
59m52s: yeah so Kristoff is saying the same
59m53s: thing actually I did look into this once
59m55s: you can actually send a payload in get
59m57s: it&amp;#39;s you know it doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense
59m59s: but technically you can in an HP request
60m1s: but you wouldn&amp;#39;t want to and it doesn&amp;#39;t
60m3s: make any sense and you definitely don&amp;#39;t
60m4s: want to in no data so let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s
60m7s: implement this let me go here now the
60m9s: other thing is why is it in the same
60m12s: let&amp;#39;s just add this
60m13s: here let&amp;#39;s add another thing let&amp;#39;s go
60m16s: down here h no let&amp;#39;s not do that let&amp;#39;s
60m19s: not do that let&amp;#39;s just do it here uh
60m20s: create a where is it Services yeah
60m22s: create a file new file service .js let&amp;#39;s
60m26s: bang that in there save
60m28s: that there we go refresh now the fact
60m33s: that we put it in a file with the same
60m36s: name as the um CDs file convention over
60m40s: configuration cap will do the right
60m42s: thing if we were for example to say move
60m45s: services.job banana. JS right and rerun
60m50s: that no Handler right because it&amp;#39;s
60m53s: saying well you know I don&amp;#39;t know where
60m55s: the Handler is but we can we can
60m57s: annotate this by to say imput we can you
61m0s: know convention over configuration but
61m1s: you can change anything and everything
61m3s: if you really want to imple banana. JS
61m6s: there we go is that how we do it I can&amp;#39;t
61m7s: remember oh sorry put in the wrong place
61m10s: service
61m11s: there uh at imple there save that now
61m16s: the implementation for this service is
61m19s: in a file called banana. JS let&amp;#39;s I
61m21s: don&amp;#39;t know rning there we go and
61m25s: there we go so we just basically
61m28s: experiment don&amp;#39;t be scared to make
61m30s: mistakes you can&amp;#39;t make mistakes we&amp;#39;re
61m32s: at the top of the hour so let&amp;#39;s continue
61m34s: this next uh episode um we got so much
61m37s: more to cover in the CDs watch we
61m39s: haven&amp;#39;t even begun to look at all the
61m40s: different log output records but let me
61m42s: know if this has been helpful let me
61m43s: know if this is like too rambly just
61m46s: just direct me um you know I don&amp;#39;t know
61m49s: what to say uh I just say whatever comes
61m52s: out my brain um but try it out go and
61m56s: play with it start feeling comfortable
61m58s: with it and it&amp;#39;s amazing see you next
62m0s: time bye for now thanks for
62m23s: joining
