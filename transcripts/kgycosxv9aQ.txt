7m9s: official term I think it&amp;#39;s cap plugins
7m11s: you um because it&amp;#39;s more about you know

8m52s: we had right at the very end and I sort
8m56s: of did this as a sort of a cliffhanger
8m58s: um I added a new element to the author&amp;#39;s
9m4s: entity type or entity definition right
9m8s: good morning Ian good morning fellow
9m10s: straa Runner Ian fantastic um I am very
9m14s: proud to stand sort of not quite
9m15s: shoulder Tosh shoulder with you because
9m16s: you&amp;#39;re an amazing Runner but yeah straa
9m18s: fantastic Daniel Scher says cap plugins
9m20s: are implemented using the CDs plugin
9m22s: technique oh just a confuse us thank you
9m24s: very much Daniel that&amp;#39;s brilliant by the
9m26s: way folks um I had a great chat with
9m29s: Daniel uh For an upcoming sap code talk
9m33s: episode on Cat plugins so uh watch this
9m37s: space um yeah watch this space so uh
9m42s: where are we yes so here is where we
9m44s: left off it&amp;#39;s still super super simple
9m46s: and where I want to get to whether it&amp;#39;s
9m48s: this week or whether it&amp;#39;s next week is
9m51s: to start thinking about relating the
9m54s: book&amp;#39;s entity with the author&amp;#39;s entity
9m56s: right because you know these are sort of
9m57s: separate entities right now there&amp;#39;s no
9m59s: no relationship between them in fact
10m0s: let&amp;#39;s just uh start the CDs watch um
10m3s: remember if you remember you&amp;#39;ll um
10m5s: you&amp;#39;ll see we actually now have
10m8s: implemented implemented you know
10m10s: deployed to an actual file based uh SQL
10m14s: light persistence layer you can see
10m15s: there connect to DB sqlite URL is
10m17s: Bookshop do sqlite which is that file
10m20s: there um so that it&amp;#39;s all in the file
10m23s: and um now if we go to uh Local Host 404
10m28s: we can see those things there we can see
10m30s: the books and remember we&amp;#39;ve got the the
10m32s: guids right the guids because the cuid
10m36s: aspect right aspect for entities with
10m39s: canonical Universal IDs um is as
10m42s: decorated that&amp;#39;s not the right word but
10m44s: anyway I&amp;#39;m going to use it decorated
10m46s: this entity or both entities with an ID
10m48s: element which is a key element as well
10m50s: which is that one there and remember we
10m52s: put the IDS we generated those uu IDs
10m54s: and put them into our sort of C CSV
10m58s: files uh cheyan I love you too cheyan
11m1s: thank you very much indeed a uh one
11m3s: about the great things about the
11m4s: weekends is a DJ session oh fantastic so
11m7s: I&amp;#39;ve got my um hands on SCB Dev mug a
11m9s: wol at 8: a.m. can every any anybody on
11m12s: anybody like an old timer from the hands
11m14s: onb Dev days when this phrase came
11m17s: up Ian subbs can&amp;#39;t beat the early
11m19s: morning runs a DJ must be amazing Along
11m21s: The Canal at the moment with the Mist
11m22s: yes it is it&amp;#39;s fantastic sometimes in
11m24s: the winter it was quite dangerous
11m26s: because it was Pitch Black and it was
11m28s: muddy as well and you know there&amp;#39;s a few
11m30s: times when I almost went into the drink
11m31s: into the canal into the drink but anyway
11m35s: um so we got that and we got the books
11m37s: there we got the authors we&amp;#39;ve also got
11m41s: this thing in the so right okay so let&amp;#39;s
11m43s: start thinking slowly because yeah I
11m45s: want to get to where we start
11m48s: associating oh I&amp;#39;ve given the game away
11m50s: there with the key word we want to start
11m53s: building a relationship between the
11m54s: books and the authors obviously right
11m58s: but I want to take a roundabout
12m0s: root so imagine I was thinking about
12m3s: this this morning right imagine um oh
12m7s: hello Hector again I recently discovered
12m9s: this series about cap and rushed the
12m10s: previous videos the last two days I love
12m12s: this series that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m awake at 5:00
12m13s: a.m.
12m15s: Hector lovely lovely to hear fantastic
12m18s: thank you so imagine um you&amp;#39;re going to
12m22s: do something and you need a tool and
12m23s: there&amp;#39;s a big Warehouse of tools with
12m25s: lots of things built and you know you&amp;#39;re
12m26s: walking past the warehouse and you could
12m28s: just put your head in the door and just
12m30s: grab the tool and come out and go and do
12m32s: the thing right but we&amp;#39;re not going to
12m34s: do that I don&amp;#39;t want to do that I want
12m35s: to take us all for a little journey into
12m38s: the warehouse to discover what else
12m40s: there is in there and what tools are
12m42s: connected and maybe what tools are made
12m44s: by what other tools and are used by
12m46s: other tools and everything so we&amp;#39;re
12m47s: going to take a bit of a a long route to
12m51s: get to an understanding of how we might
12m56s: relate the books to the authors let&amp;#39;s go
12m58s: back here I&amp;#39;m talking about that right
12m59s: books and
13m1s: authors and that roundabout route starts
13m5s: with this this country of birth random
13m8s: element you know let&amp;#39;s just make
13m10s: something up an author is born somewhere
13m12s: right so let&amp;#39;s have a country of birth
13m14s: and this type country right
13m17s: so um let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s pick apart what this
13m20s: has done because it tells us loads and
13m22s: loads and
13m24s: loads so what is this this is a type
13m28s: this you know this is part of the vs
13m30s: code extension for cap right so I&amp;#39;ve got
13m33s: the vs code extension if you remember um
13m35s: in the dev container uh extensions why
13m37s: is it taking so long I think I think
13m39s: basically any internet activity is going
13m42s: to take ages so I wait for that to come
13m43s: back um but basically this is oh there
13m47s: we go um come on come on come on sap CDs
13m50s: language support so basically that
13m53s: extension is giving me all this goodness
13m56s: right so you know hover over there and
13m58s: we get that little thing there
14m0s: so this is a type now we can also CU in
14m4s: order to use this type what I did of
14m6s: course is I imported it
14m9s: using what I just did then was I dived
14m13s: into common CDs okay so just go there
14m17s: again in fact I put that down there can
14m19s: I put that down there yeah there we go
14m20s: there we go there we go right
14m23s: so in my services. CDs which is here
14m27s: this is basically my CDs DJ CDs our CDs
14m31s: definition we&amp;#39;ve got an element that is
14m34s: described by this thing called country
14m36s: that we&amp;#39;ve imported from here right now
14m40s: in sap CDs com it used to be in the
14m42s: olden days in the good old days correct
14m44s: me if I&amp;#39;m wrong uh Daniel but it used to
14m46s: be a file that was delivered but now
14m48s: it&amp;#39;s actually been made into an npm
14m50s: package okay so you can as you can see
14m52s: here that&amp;#39;s not a file descriptor that&amp;#39;s
14m55s: not you know a file path that&amp;#39;s an at
14m57s: thing so that tells as it&amp;#39;s an mpm
14m59s: package right in
15m2s: fact if we have a look it&amp;#39;s not in there
15m5s: it&amp;#39;s sort of implicit right anyway
15m7s: anyway anyway
15m9s: anyway so we can sort of specify files
15m12s: or npm packages inside the npm package
15m15s: which is basically in here node modules
15m18s: sap CDs so it&amp;#39;s there node modules sap
15m23s: CDs common where is it common. CDs which
15m26s: is basically that one there
15m29s: we&amp;#39;ve got a ton of definitions go right
15m31s: to the top so we start we got type
15m34s: language type currency type country so
15m37s: let&amp;#39;s stop there thank you Kevin
15m39s: fantastic thank you Kevin for oh you&amp;#39;ve
15m41s: changed your name as well brilliant
15m44s: um we&amp;#39;ve got this type definition now
15m47s: remember if we look at
15m49s: cuid CU ID that is defined in here as
15m54s: well but that&amp;#39;s defined as an aspect and
15m56s: an aspect is something that you sort of
15m58s: stick here you decorate an entire entity
16m2s: with an aspect but if we want to define
16m7s: an element and have something that&amp;#39;s
16m8s: other than the built-in types like
16m10s: string and integer and Boolean and you
16m13s: know whatever U
16m15s: ID we can Define our own types so here&amp;#39;s
16m19s: a type a common type that&amp;#39;s been defined
16m21s: for us let&amp;#39;s go back to country where is
16m23s: it go right to the top because notice at
16m25s: the top this is another thing we&amp;#39;re
16m27s: discovering here by digging into this I
16m30s: good morning to you in Frankfurt by
16m32s: digging into this at the top there&amp;#39;s no
16m34s: sort of name space or anything yet we
16m37s: know about name spaces right um or do we
16m39s: know about name spaces and name spaces
16m41s: you know think of java think of
16m42s: basically package names and everything
16m44s: we haven&amp;#39;t really covered name spaces
16m46s: yet but basically you can put a name
16m47s: space in somewhere I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ve seen
16m49s: it in examples and then you know
16m53s: namespace um you know Bookshop do
16m55s: bananas okay and then you all the
16m57s: entities defined after that in the file
16m59s: have that namespace prefix okay it&amp;#39;s
17m1s: just a
17m2s: name and it&amp;#39;s namespaces are really
17m4s: important for lots of different things
17m5s: including you know making sure you don&amp;#39;t
17m7s: step on your your fellow developers Toes
17m9s: or your other te your other team&amp;#39;s toes
17m12s: uh you know when you define things
17m14s: anyway that&amp;#39;s coming shortly so type
17m17s: where is it type country but check out
17m20s: what type country is it&amp;#39;s not like a a
17m22s: Scala type it&amp;#39;s not like just a you know
17m24s: a string of 10 10 characters or
17m27s: something what is it it&amp;#39;s an association
17m30s: to sap common countries so all already
17m33s: we&amp;#39;re in the warehouse already we&amp;#39;re
17m34s: looking at the shelves of
17m36s: stuff that&amp;#39;s available to
17m39s: us in the CDs language
17m42s: World okay AI says it is breaking once
17m45s: in a while but does not cause any issue
17m46s: to follow you thank you very much for
17m47s: letting me know keep letting me know how
17m49s: this is
17m50s: right so um where was oh yeah so there&amp;#39;s
17m55s: a million things here so type this is
17m57s: how you define your own
17m59s: types you can find your own types right
18m2s: what is this type it&amp;#39;s an
18m4s: association I&amp;#39;m going to jump over
18m7s: Association somebody in the chat put
18m9s: what they think this association means
18m12s: and what it does okay while I ask you to
18m16s: put that in the chat what you think
18m18s: Association is let&amp;#39;s just have a look
18m21s: what this is to sap. common. countries
18m25s: so this is like a bit of a a name prefix
18m27s: right so where is that defined well if
18m30s: we hold down uh command again on Mac OS
18m32s: or control I suppose on
18m34s: Windows click on that code list for
18m37s: countries there&amp;#39;s another term code list
18m39s: because one of the let me know in the
18m41s: chat as well one of the things I find a
18m45s: the most fascinating but also B
18m48s: potentially quite overwhelming is the
18m51s: number of terms so let&amp;#39;s just let this
18m54s: wash over us and let&amp;#39;s just let it seep
18m57s: into our brains and stare at this stuff
18m59s: so that it becomes more familiar so this
19m2s: is a code list what is a code list we
19m5s: don&amp;#39;t know let&amp;#39;s find out what a code
19m6s: list is countries so let&amp;#39;s just command
19m9s: click there we jump down further into
19m12s: the file right notice this breadcrumb
19m16s: thing that VSS code gives us so it&amp;#39;s in
19m18s: a file in the node modules at sap CDs
19m21s: directory it&amp;#39;s in a file called common.
19m23s: CDs and it&amp;#39;s within a name space or a
19m27s: context
19m28s: called sap. common and this I suppose
19m31s: just gives us the um the last part of
19m33s: that namespace common common brackets
19m36s: package you can see it there on line 33
19m38s: sap. common okay um and then within
19m42s: sap.com within that context notice that
19m44s: it&amp;#39;s an Open Bracket we&amp;#39;ve got this this
19m46s: entity defined inside
19m49s: sap.com this is like a bit of a head
19m51s: explosion but you know we&amp;#39;s do it as
19m52s: slow as we we need
19m54s: to inside the sep.com we&amp;#39;ve got what
19m58s: this this countryes thing is so the fact
19m59s: that we&amp;#39;ve got entity countries the name
20m3s: of this entity really is sap. common do
20m7s: countries okay think of context as a
20m10s: sort of a as an infile some some
20m13s: namespace definition uh oh sorry a
20m16s: namespace declaration that you can have
20m20s: within a file it&amp;#39;s almost like you know
20m22s: um you know well yeah you can have
20m24s: multiple contexts defined I you can Nest
20m28s: them you can have them sort of you know
20m29s: as peers in a file and so on okay have
20m32s: some water actually so um AI says a
20m35s: reference to another table AK CDs sadish
20m38s: good morning to you chakia good morning
20m41s: you&amp;#39;re late to time but it&amp;#39;s okay you&amp;#39;re
20m44s: welcome so um so a so AI is Right a
20m49s: reference to another table well I say a
20m51s: refer cuz table is more of a persistence
20m54s: layer thing so let&amp;#39;s remain thinking
20m56s: let&amp;#39;s try and remain thinking at the CD
20m58s: s level so I&amp;#39;m going to say really
21m0s: vaguely it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a reference to a
21m4s: relationship to another thing right
21m6s: let&amp;#39;s go back again actually um let&amp;#39;s go
21m8s: back up to here type where is it type
21m11s: country Association to sap common
21m14s: countries and we when we jump there we
21m15s: know it&amp;#39;s an
21m17s: entity okay so we&amp;#39;re going to we&amp;#39;re
21m20s: going
21m21s: to explore this this Warehouse of stuff
21m24s: very briefly then can sort of roll back
21m26s: up again so we got an entity defined for
21m31s: us called countries and that&amp;#39;s why also
21m34s: we see
21m35s: here that we&amp;#39;ve got in our service
21m39s: endpoints the list of entities that are
21m41s: available we can see countries okay and
21m43s: at the moment of course there&amp;#39;s nothing
21m45s: in countries in fact let me put my head
21m47s: down there so you can see the top
21m48s: there&amp;#39;s nothing in countries because we
21m51s: don&amp;#39;t we haven&amp;#39;t specified any sort of
21m53s: you know initial data we&amp;#39;ve got
21m54s: bookshops authors Bookshop
21m56s: books but we haven&amp;#39;t got anything
22m0s: for countries
22m2s: now put in the chat if we wanted to put
22m7s: to have some CSV data to sort of
22m9s: prepopulate the list of
22m13s: countries what would be the name of the
22m16s: file in this data directory would it be
22m18s: Bookshop do countries or would it be
22m20s: something else have have a thing and put
22m21s: it in the
22m22s: chat now if we have a look here for
22m26s: example um cap Cloud sap docs CDs common
22m30s: entity countries um let me just put that
22m33s: on um the third one there let while
22m36s: that&amp;#39;s
22m37s: loading let&amp;#39;s have a look has this
22m39s: entity countries only got one element a
22m44s: key element a code element so there
22m46s: there&amp;#39;s lots of things going on what
22m48s: we&amp;#39;re going to do is ignore for now
22m50s: these annotations we&amp;#39;re not going to
22m51s: talk about annotations because there&amp;#39;s
22m53s: only so much I think we should look at
22m55s: at the you know in one go so think about
22m59s: the entity
23m0s: definition we&amp;#39;ve got a single element
23m3s: the name of which is code is defined as
23m6s: a you know quite a simple scaler type A
23m9s: String three character string okay and
23m13s: we can sort of guess what that might be
23m14s: you know uh gbr for Great Britain or you
23m18s: know um deu for deutchland uh or de you
23m22s: know two characters three characters I
23m23s: think there&amp;#39;s an ISO standard 3166 I&amp;#39;m
23m25s: going to guess uh oh no sorry 42 3166
23m30s: was the U wasn&amp;#39;t it uh 4217 a threel
23m34s: alpha code right oh sorry that&amp;#39;s
23m36s: currencies um oh what where is it where
23m39s: is it where is it where is
23m41s: it countries oh it is 3166 3166 two
23m46s: letter Alpha codes as primary keys for
23m48s: example oh this really annoys me this
23m49s: really annoys me for example GB for the
23m52s: United Kingdom anybody any any folks in
23m54s: the chat from UK Hector Hector&amp;#39;s got it
23m57s: right SA p. common. countries and
24m0s: Raphael has got it right in a sort of a
24m1s: meta sense exactly name space entity
24m5s: name right so in fact let&amp;#39;s yeah let&amp;#39;s
24m9s: let&amp;#39;s digress let&amp;#39;s digress let&amp;#39;s
24m11s: control C
24m13s: remember
24m15s: here um Z for example Garfield Says Z
24m19s: for South Africa exactly um does does
24m22s: that come from the Africans sort of the
24m24s: Flemish the Dutch zud with a zed South
24m27s: Africa
24m29s: maybe maybe maybe there is a package
24m31s: maybe uh the community could create a
24m33s: package that you could import that would
24m36s: I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t know anyway that&amp;#39;s
24m37s: a that&amp;#39;s a great Point zud Africa
24m39s: exactly Garfield thank you very much for
24m40s: confirming that zud as in you know um
24m44s: the the Flemish for South so when I you
24m47s: know I travel to uh Europe I you know
24m50s: sometimes get the Euro star from London
24m51s: some panas to um Brussels midi or
24m55s: Brussels zud um anyway DJ stop
24m58s: digressing um what we&amp;#39;re going to do oh
25m0s: yes so CDs
25m2s: ad remember this CDs ad if we say CDs
25m5s: add
25m8s: d-el we can add CSV headers for modeled
25m12s: entities so what happens if we see CDs
25m15s: add-- data right let me close this up
25m21s: here oh CD oh sorry CDs add data adding
25m26s: feature data look at this and because of
25m29s: convention we are sort of defining
25m31s: convention at the moment by putting our
25m33s: CSV files in a data directory the sort
25m36s: of standard convention is to have the
25m40s: persistence layer uh CDs and
25m43s: accompanying sort of CSV
25m45s: files in a directory called DB remember
25m49s: early on in the series we looked at the
25m51s: three directories that are generated
25m53s: look watch this watch this watch this if
25m54s: we go to I I know um let&amp;#39;s do it here
25m57s: instead just in case uh CD temp CDs init
26m1s: that bigger CDs init uh test prod right
26m5s: CDs in it Test Pro creating new C
26m8s: project in Test Pro CD Test Pro tree
26m12s: there we go and what happens is it
26m15s: defines for us it creates for us when it
26m18s: initializes a project a simple package
26m22s: Json there right dead simple and it
26m25s: creates three empty director
26m28s: app for the front end stuff DB for the
26m31s: persistence layer stuff as in for where
26m34s: you define your entities and the
26m36s: relationships between your entities and
26m37s: serve for your sort of service level
26m40s: stuff remember we covered this before
26m41s: right so hey we don&amp;#39;t need that anymore
26m44s: um and what it&amp;#39;s done is it&amp;#39;s created
26m47s: the data directory inside the DB
26m50s: directory which didn&amp;#39;t exist so it&amp;#39;s you
26m52s: know sort of autocreated it it um what&amp;#39;s
26m54s: the what&amp;#39;s that Pearl word it um Auto
26m58s: Auto vivified it auto vivification it&amp;#39;s
27m0s: sort of creation of the the things along
27m3s: the way to create what you need to
27m4s: create type thing sort of Auto
27m7s: verification
27m8s: pearl auto
27m12s: vivification what is auto verification
27m15s: yes um Pearl programming language there
27m17s: we go automatic creation of new arrays
27m18s: and hashes as required every time an
27m20s: undefined value is dot dot dot CU my
27m22s: internet&amp;#39;s too
27m23s: slow DJ when your internet&amp;#39;s slow it&amp;#39;s
27m27s: even less of a reason to
27m28s: digress so what it&amp;#39;s now done as uh who
27m32s: was it as Raphael and Hector says look
27m35s: sa. com- countries namespace
27m39s: sap.com entity name right anyway that&amp;#39;s
27m43s: fine so let&amp;#39;s just uh go back down
27m47s: again what else have we got we know the
27m49s: code is
27m51s: key but also this
27m54s: entity is decorated with a another thing
27m58s: which is an aspect which defines a code
28m1s: list so it&amp;#39;s like you know I&amp;#39;ll let you
28m4s: watch this again and dig down yourself
28m6s: because this is definitely definitely
28m8s: definitely worth digging into so what is
28m10s: a code list aspect a Cod list aspect
28m13s: we&amp;#39;ve seen aspects before haven&amp;#39;t we
28m15s: there&amp;#39;s an aspect cuid that just adds in
28m18s: fact we if we go there the aspect cuid
28m20s: just adds a single element I called ID
28m24s: it defines it as a key element and it
28m26s: defines it of base type uuid we know
28m29s: that already right go back again do we
28m31s: go can we go back like that perfect
28m33s: brilliant um and we got this cont so now
28m36s: we&amp;#39;ve got this country aspect and the
28m37s: country aspect is an entity called
28m39s: countries which is also decorated itself
28m42s: with an aspect which adds two elements
28m46s: to it so name and description now this
28m48s: is a lot to think about okay this is a
28m52s: lot to think about so let&amp;#39;s have a
28m54s: look now we&amp;#39; sort of
28m57s: gently and skim the surface of this
29m0s: stuff here if we have a look at the
29m3s: countries it doesn&amp;#39;t oh I&amp;#39;m not reading
29m5s: thing CDs
29m7s: watch come on come on come on come on
29m9s: come
29m13s: on there if we uh look at the countries
29m17s: it doesn&amp;#39;t really tell us much but but
29m19s: if we have a look at the metadata let&amp;#39;s
29m22s: make that a little bit bigger where is
29m24s: it we&amp;#39;ve got um we&amp;#39;ll come back to the
29m27s: entity container in a second but we have
29m29s: here entity name I&amp;#39;ll just highlight the
29m32s: that bit there ignore the country&amp;#39;s text
29m34s: Cu that&amp;#39;s even more exciting
29m38s: right we all know and we&amp;#39;re all happy
29m41s: with I hope let me know if you&amp;#39;re not in
29m43s: the chat with OD data metadata documents
29m46s: and the XML and the what we&amp;#39;re defining
29m49s: here what we have defined here for
29m52s: example is the equivalent of what we&amp;#39;ve
29m54s: defined here entity authors with a Cy ID
29m57s: aspect so we&amp;#39;ve got the ID from the CU
30m0s: ID we&amp;#39;ve got the name property here from
30m2s: the name element here and we also have
30m6s: this country of birth but it&amp;#39;s a
30m8s: navigation property why is it a
30m10s: navigation property because can I go
30m13s: back here in the file as
30m16s: well uh yeah there we go look this
30m21s: navigation property where is
30m24s: it there let me highlight that
30m28s: so stare at that green bit and have a
30m30s: look over here country of birth is
30m33s: defined with a type country but that
30m34s: type country is an association
30m39s: so the answer to what is this
30m42s: Association it&amp;#39;s a relationship between
30m45s: two entities and that relationship in od
30m48s: data is
30m49s: expressed as a navigation property as
30m53s: you&amp;#39;d expect in od data so we have the
30m55s: navigation property country of birth
30m57s: where does that go to it goes to
31m0s: Bookshop do countries which is an entity
31m3s: type and of course you know because of
31m5s: the way the OD is defined and everything
31m6s: we have this entity set here entity set
31m10s: name countries of type Bookshop
31m14s: countries Let&amp;#39;s ignore the underscore
31m16s: text for a
31m17s: minute so if we now have a look at
31m20s: entity type name equals countries where
31m23s: is it there we can see
31m28s: the country&amp;#39;s entity type for which is&amp;#39;s
31m31s: an entity
31m32s: set comprises three properties name
31m37s: description and code it&amp;#39;s also got some
31m40s: navigation properties but we&amp;#39;ll again
31m42s: come on to those
31m44s: later name and description come exactly
31m48s: from the code list look name and
31m52s: description because the code list is
31m55s: used to decorate as an aspect the
31m58s: country&amp;#39;s entity which itself has a
32m1s: single element property code okay now
32m6s: one of the oh yeah that&amp;#39;s it one of the
32m7s: things that really annoys me um is that
32m10s: ISO ISO the organization it leaves a lot
32m13s: to be desired to be
32m15s: honest how can you get it ISO so wrong
32m19s: United Kingdom consists of Great Britain
32m22s: and Northern Ireland so why have GB as
32m25s: the representation for something that is
32m29s: greater than what GB is as in United
32m32s: Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
32m34s: Ireland anyway rant over you know what
32m37s: do I know what do I know I&amp;#39;m just an
32m39s: idiot Raphael says is it okay to ask
32m41s: some off top ask some off topic
32m43s: questions or will there be a Q&amp;amp;A later
32m45s: Raphael ask away I may not be able to
32m47s: answer the question but this is what
32m49s: this is what the live stream is all
32m51s: about you know asking questions having
32m53s: chat with each other um asking me
32m55s: questions like I say I might not be able
32m56s: to answer there might be somebody else
32m57s: who can answer on the chat or I can find
32m59s: out and ask ask answer next time so yes
33m1s: please ask
33m3s: away by the way somebody put in the chat
33m5s: is this is this helpful am I confusing
33m7s: you more than I&amp;#39;m helping you let me
33m9s: know so countries why don&amp;#39;t we add why
33m13s: don&amp;#39;t we add into here just so we can
33m15s: sort of understand and let&amp;#39;s add it in
33m17s: this file here sap common countries
33m19s: there we go code name description so if
33m21s: we say code GB I hate it name United
33m26s: Kingdom
33m27s: of Great Britain and
33m33s: Northern Island um description
33m36s: brexitland there we go how about that
33m38s: we&amp;#39;ll have one more de um
33m41s: Germany uh home of the
33m45s: sap Mothership for example right there
33m49s: we go uh Gregorian hello to you so now
33m54s: we can see code name description code
33m56s: name description and also we&amp;#39;ve got in
33m59s: the country here we where is it
34m2s: code code and then we&amp;#39;ve got name and
34m7s: description now if we go back we can see
34m10s: countries oh ah now tell me why has why
34m15s: has that still not
34m18s: um uh still not appeared okay if we
34m22s: added before um if we had added data to
34m25s: a CSV file and the service
34m29s: restarts okay why don&amp;#39;t we see countries
34m32s: let&amp;#39;s pause there for a second because
34m34s: maybe I&amp;#39;m going too fast maybe I&amp;#39;m going
34m36s: too fast let&amp;#39;s pause there for a second
34m37s: and also to give Raphael a chance to ask
34m39s: the question are there any downsides to
34m41s: oh I see the word neovim coming up in
34m43s: the sentence here are there any
34m45s: downsides to using neovim instead of vs
34m47s: code for ui5 and cap development at the
34m51s: moment that&amp;#39;s a good question I
34m54s: think I mean part of me wants to say of
34m56s: course there&amp;#39;s no downsides I mean
34m58s: neovim is the best editor and you know
35m1s: combined with other tools is the
35m4s: IDE the best IDE in the
35m7s: world however I think the downside is
35m10s: that it will always
35m13s: be um a
35m15s: secondary Target at best for tools that
35m20s: come from sap and other organizations
35m23s: for doing this sort of stuff so for
35m25s: example
35m28s: of course we have for vs
35m31s: code like I mentioned
35m33s: before the sap CDs language support
35m38s: extension which is an amazing extension
35m40s: with all sorts of features and
35m42s: functionalities that is designed
35m44s: specifically to work with vs code and of
35m47s: course with the business applications
35m49s: you do Dev spaces
35m50s: right now that means that you know I
35m53s: can&amp;#39;t go ahead and just somehow
35m56s: magically easily plug this extension
35m58s: into neovim what I can do though um is
36m2s: use and Garfield&amp;#39;s saying the same thing
36m4s: right I can actually use the core of
36m8s: what the sap CDs language support is
36m10s: which is basically a language server for
36m13s: CDs somebody in the chat put what a
36m17s: language server is and what the language
36m19s: server protocol is it&amp;#39;s actually came
36m21s: from VSS code the language so yeah I&amp;#39;ll
36m23s: I&amp;#39;ll let you I&amp;#39;ll let you answer to that
36m25s: so there is
36m27s: a um a oh I can&amp;#39;t where I can&amp;#39;t remember
36m30s: where it is there&amp;#39;s a GitHub project by
36m32s: a colleague here at sap um that where
36m36s: they have CU I I very early on I created
36m39s: a wrapper around the parts of the
36m42s: library that was that were inside this
36m44s: extension you know uh so cap a cap
36m47s: library that was basically the language
36m48s: server for TDS I wrapped that in a bit
36m51s: of Vim script and used it in Vim there&amp;#39;s
36m54s: now for neovim a a plugin that does the
36m57s: same thing but better because mine was a
36m59s: bit rubbish with syntax highlighting as
37m2s: well using um using uh tree
37m5s: sitter and uh so you can actually in
37m9s: neovim work with CDs quite nicely not as
37m13s: nicely yet as what you can do in vs code
37m16s: but yeah so it will always lag a little
37m18s: bit behind and it will only catch up
37m21s: when people like you know us build extra
37m25s: bits to help neovim sort of benefit from
37m29s: the stuff that&amp;#39;s being built for other
37m31s: tools does that make
37m32s: sense um uh so Hector says yes it&amp;#39;s
37m36s: helpful I&amp;#39;m getting friendly with the
37m37s: metadata now yes fantastic get friendly
37m39s: with the metadata get friendly with the
37m41s: CDs with the cap server output um chakia
37m45s: um LSP not quite lisp lisp is a you know
37m48s: is a is a family of languages you know a
37m50s: functional uh family language like
37m52s: scheme is also a you know a lisp uh
37m54s: closure is a lisp but that&amp;#39;s not what
37m56s: we&amp;#39;re talking about here um is LSP
37m59s: language server protocol exactly so
38m1s: maybe it&amp;#39;s was just a typo yes exactly
38m3s: the protocol for language server so the
38m4s: idea of a language server is you&amp;#39;ll have
38m6s: a language like CDs like Java like go
38m9s: like
38m11s: lure um and different editors will want
38m15s: to have features for that language right
38m18s: in the in the editors so why write and
38m20s: rewrite for every single editor out
38m22s: there you know intellig net beans vs
38m25s: code whatever atom all you know and
38m29s: reinvent these things so instead have a
38m32s: language server which knows everything
38m34s: there is to know about and provides
38m36s: features for a certain language CDs for
38m38s: example and then have this protocol that
38m40s: the editor can connect to this language
38m42s: server and asks the server for help for
38m44s: that language that&amp;#39;s what sa the sap cap
38m47s: team have developed in the form of this
38m50s: sap CDs language support and you know
38m51s: that&amp;#39;s a bit more as well so yeah so the
38m53s: sap FY tools also have a lot of
38m55s: functionality for vs code and business
38m56s: application exactly so I understand how
38m58s: but I&amp;#39;m not sure the why we should
38m59s: prefer a country&amp;#39;s Association is is it
39m1s: to get the OD navigation functionality
39m4s: ah okay okay so let me just read that
39m6s: again I understand the how but I&amp;#39;m not
39m7s: sure about the why we should prefer a
39m9s: country&amp;#39;s
39m11s: Association um are you talking about why
39m16s: we have an association rather than just
39m19s: a
39m20s: type I think it&amp;#39;s and if that&amp;#39;s the case
39m24s: um it is partly to get the O dat
39m26s: navigation functionality but that for me
39m29s: is just a nice side effect of having
39m32s: sort of at the data level separation of
39m35s: concerns you know you define your
39m37s: countryes
39m39s: once refer to them as a with a
39m42s: code and then they can be
39m44s: maintained separately and
39m47s: independently from the records that
39m51s: point to or have references to countries
39m53s: so for example here let me just close
39m56s: that that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s a great question um
39m58s: let&amp;#39;s just leave that there for a minute
40m0s: uh go back to services
40m2s: so I could of course put country of
40m5s: birth and then have um type you know a
40m9s: three character string there and have D
40m12s: UK FR for France or whatever right um
40m17s: but we we might want to for example have
40m23s: different translations for different Nam
40m26s: for for example the French for the
40m28s: French this is this is So Meta the
40m30s: French for Germany is Alania right the
40m33s: the English for Germany is Germany the
40m34s: German for Germany is deut right so you
40m37s: you&amp;#39;d want different local variants of
40m41s: the long text versions of these these
40m44s: these sort of generic pieces of data so
40m46s: it makes makes a lot more sense for me
40m49s: to have this data in a separate entity
40m52s: where you can manage it and have extra
40m54s: information about it right for example
40m56s: for example um here now notice that the
41m2s: description home of the sap Mothership
41m4s: that&amp;#39;s in English but one of the things
41m6s: we saw
41m8s: here where&amp;#39;s my copy one of the things
41m10s: we saw when we&amp;#39;re
41m12s: exploring right
41m15s: is um where was it oh yeah here we go
41m18s: here we go when we look at the metadata
41m20s: we also
41m22s: noticed that for example if we have a
41m24s: look at the entity set name countries
41m26s: and so this this is great and this is
41m28s: exactly why we are sort of
41m30s: metaphorically walking around the
41m33s: warehouse of stuff that&amp;#39;s in sap CDs uh
41m38s: sap CDs common right is teaching us
41m43s: different things we&amp;#39;ve come across types
41m44s: and aspects we Cod the idea of a code
41m47s: list the idea of an association you know
41m49s: and this will do more associations
41m51s: later okay
41m54s: um but we also have
41m57s: seen in the generation of this that
42m1s: we&amp;#39;ve got this entity set countries with
42m2s: this mysterious navigation property
42m5s: binding texts within a target of yet
42m8s: another entity type countryes texts what
42m12s: the heck is that where has that come
42m14s: from and if you remember if we remember
42m17s: when we last week we said CDs um compile
42m22s: if we compile let&amp;#39;s have look at the
42m23s: services let&amp;#39;s at the services there
42m25s: right um
42m26s: ah yeah okay tell you what let&amp;#39;s save
42m28s: that let&amp;#39;s save it yeah this is I think
42m30s: this is worth thinking hard about so let
42m33s: me know in the chat if you&amp;#39;re okay in
42m35s: know slowing down and thinking hard
42m37s: about these questions and not rushing to
42m39s: get onto associations we can get onto
42m42s: associations how the how the type the
42m46s: country type is an association and then
42m48s: build that up to association between
42m49s: books and authors with the knowledge we
42m51s: gain next week so let me know if it&amp;#39;s
42m53s: okay to continue on this journey with
42m56s: all all these brilliant questions okay
42m58s: um so for example Garfield says country
43m0s: names changed Burma became Myanmar
43m2s: exactly exactly
43m5s: um
43m7s: so let&amp;#39;s just save this for a second
43m9s: note that in vs code that means it&amp;#39;s not
43m11s: saved so I&amp;#39;ll press control whatever you
43m13s: know old command s or col W because I&amp;#39;ve
43m16s: got the um I&amp;#39;ve got the uh Vim where is
43m19s: it uh in my not compile if we compile
43m22s: let&amp;#39;s get rid of that and that for a
43m24s: second CDs compile let&amp;#39;s compile this
43m28s: that&amp;#39;s all we&amp;#39;ve got we don&amp;#39;t need
43m30s: country anymore so let&amp;#39;s get rid of that
43m31s: just so visually so oh we don&amp;#39;t want to
43m34s: get rid of that uh there so
43m36s: that&amp;#39;s simple simple simple simple CDs
43m41s: compile to
43m43s: SQL Services right we&amp;#39;ve done this
43m46s: before but let&amp;#39;s do it again Ian says uh
43m49s: it&amp;#39;s fine by me it&amp;#39;s the deeper stuff
43m50s: that sets this apart from other sessions
43m52s: thank you okay good good good good let&amp;#39;s
43m54s: dig in so I&amp;#39;ve changed this country of
43m57s: birth element to be defined as a simple
43m59s: scaler type of of a three character
44m1s: string right three by
44m3s: string we&amp;#39;re back to something super
44m6s: simple country of birth nvarchar
44m10s: 3 and that&amp;#39;s where to go back to um AI
44m14s: is great question you know we could get
44m16s: get away with that okay and Define and
44m19s: for every single author for every single
44m21s: record where we have you know for
44m23s: example the authors we&amp;#39;ve got no uh no
44m26s: Fielding what&amp;#39;s going uh Ian Banks and
44m28s: Douglas NL Adams right no field
44m32s: who um we Define different things but of
44m35s: course that means that there could be
44m37s: some
44m38s: inconsistencies you know we don&amp;#39;t want
44m41s: just uncontrolled data if we&amp;#39;re going to
44m45s: have a country of birth we don&amp;#39;t uh SEO
44m48s: for Scotland or uh UK whatever and
44m51s: that&amp;#39;s you know that&amp;#39;s not consistent so
44m53s: that&amp;#39;s another reason for having a
44m54s: separate entity with a code that is
44m56s: either correct or not correct I.E
44m59s: whether it is in that separate entity
45m1s: does that make sense um okay so why is
45m4s: that so simple because we&amp;#39;ve defined
45m6s: this but now if we change this back to
45m8s: Country there and we also need to of
45m11s: course
45m12s: um save that I&amp;#39;m not sure why that is
45m15s: telling me it&amp;#39;s not uh using this Source
45m17s: because it is using in this source so
45m18s: maybe it&amp;#39;s you know install this
45m20s: extension wrong or something but now if
45m22s: we do that
45m24s: again we this explosion of stuff and we
45m28s: we sort of now starting to get the feel
45m30s: as to why there&amp;#39;s such an explosion of
45m33s: stuff we haven&amp;#39;t got a feel for uh all
45m36s: of it so let&amp;#39;s just go through this now
45m39s: because it&amp;#39;s just a ton of stuff I mean
45m41s: going from all we had before was that
45m44s: those two tables and then the country of
45m47s: birth was defined as an narar 3 right
45m50s: however it was defined as country oh
45m54s: tell you what tell you what where is
45m57s: it let me do that again let me do that
45m59s: again let me go back
46m1s: here because it&amp;#39;s something super super
46m4s: interesting here if I change back bit to
46m6s: string three for example
46m9s: right can I just do another
46m12s: terminal let&amp;#39;s put that like that and do
46m14s: a side by side split
46m16s: terminal
46m20s: now this compilation
46m24s: output
46m26s: okay is from when we had the um country
46m31s: as as the type defining this ENT uh
46m35s: element I&amp;#39;ve now changed it back to
46m37s: string if I say CDs compile to SQL
46m41s: services. CDs and we get that simple
46m45s: thing we have
46m48s: basically wo sorry that was a bit what&amp;#39;s
46m50s: going on down we have
46m53s: basically almost but not quite the same
46m56s: thing can anybody
46m58s: spot what the difference
47m1s: is
47m3s: between this create table ddl statement
47m7s: sorry these two and these
47m10s: two put in the chat what the difference
47m13s: is where the difference is right and the
47m17s: answer is basically a massive
47m21s: clue when we want to start thinking
47m24s: about associ and managed associations
47m27s: I.E relationships between entities that
47m31s: we can Define really comfortably with
47m33s: CDs where CDs does the sort of heavy
47m37s: lifting of foreign keys for us
47m41s: right so while you think of that and put
47m43s: it in the chat what the difference is
47m45s: it&amp;#39;s only five characters difference I
47m46s: think tell me what the difference is so
47m50s: um so a says uh Hector&amp;#39;s got it Hector&amp;#39;s
47m55s: got it but um tell me what you think
47m57s: tell me what you think what where that&amp;#39;s
47m58s: coming from underscore code brilliant so
48m1s: actually say I thought just like how
48m2s: there are standard countries curent
48m3s: currency packs in sap when I refer myty
48m5s: a similar pack in the background
48m6s: somewhere is referred I mean that&amp;#39;s a
48m8s: great question um I&amp;#39;m sure this question
48m10s: came up a long time ago and I can&amp;#39;t
48m12s: remember what the answer was maybe
48m14s: Daniel can comment here um I&amp;#39;m not sure
48m18s: what what what what the real desire not
48m23s: what the real desire is but what the
48m25s: consensus was it&amp;#39;s a great question let
48m27s: me let me do some digging next week and
48m30s: find out what the consensus internally
48m32s: is about this about supplying data yeah
48m36s: so that&amp;#39;s a great question so um so a AI
48m39s: says amazing got it it&amp;#39;s all about
48m40s: maintenance maintenance maintenance as
48m41s: it always has been yes exactly and an
48m43s: says if associations like foreign key as
48m45s: generally dictionary objects why haven&amp;#39;t
48m46s: we specified the cality ah what a
48m49s: brilliant question and and what a
48m50s: brilliant question and we got to get on
48m51s: to
48m52s: cardinality but the answer just to sort
48m55s: of Jump Ahead a little bit the
48m57s: answer lies in this special keyword and
49m1s: the different variants of this keyword
49m3s: called
49m5s: association association
49m7s: to Association to one something
49m11s: Association to many something okay and
49m16s: with this super beautiful sort of high
49m19s: level abstract convenience layer I&amp;#39;m
49m22s: thinking about this in terms of building
49m25s: relationship ship between entities which
49m26s: we still haven&amp;#39;t done yet you know we&amp;#39;re
49m28s: going to get to this but let&amp;#39;s talk
49m29s: about it so when we do get to it it
49m31s: makes a bit more sense hopefully right
49m34s: we can use CDs to define a relationship
49m36s: and sort of
49m38s: implicitly without having to mess about
49m41s: with
49m42s: defining fields at the persistence layer
49m45s: that are foreign key
49m47s: Fields cap does that forers by turning
49m51s: those associations and the different
49m52s: variants of those associations into
49m56s: actual relationships at the persistence
49m58s: layer that have the right
50m2s: fields for the appropriate cardinality
50m7s: now I&amp;#39;ll just jump down to what Hector
50m9s: says um in the country of birth exactly
50m13s: there is the difference country of birth
50m15s: uncore code and Country of
50m19s: birth so when let me go get rid of that
50m23s: one there this one comes from
50m26s: from that variant okay so we got this
50m28s: country and we know that
50m33s: country is a type and we know that the
50m36s: country type is defined as an
50m38s: association so to answer your question
50m40s: an
50m41s: and right we
50m44s: are implicitly specifying the
50m47s: cardinality here of this country type in
50m51s: that it&amp;#39;s an association to
50m53s: one entry
50m57s: in the sap common countries thing which
51m2s: is itself an entity which of course then
51m4s: in odata terms for example when it&amp;#39;s
51m6s: compiled to OD data and served as OD
51m9s: data becomes an entity type of which is
51m13s: there is also then an entity set well I
51m15s: haven&amp;#39;t got I haven&amp;#39;t forgotten
51m16s: underscore texts we&amp;#39;ll have to look at
51m18s: that next time I think because that&amp;#39;s
51m20s: super super interesting as well I will
51m23s: just say now um
51m26s: I will just say now that when we dig in
51m29s: to the to the Cod list
51m32s: aspect which is what we used or what was
51m35s: used to
51m38s: decorate the country&amp;#39;s entity
51m41s: definition right the Cod list has these
51m46s: two elements name and description there
51m49s: where is it where is
51m52s: it there name and description right
51m56s: what&amp;#39;s this
51m59s: localized localized is another
52m3s: CDs language
52m6s: element that does a lot of heavy lifting
52m10s: and it&amp;#39;s this localized element that
52m13s: basically you know the the clues in the
52m15s: name it basically says this
52m19s: name I want this sorry I want this
52m22s: element called name and I want this
52m23s: element called description to be
52m27s: maintainable in different
52m31s: locals right one of the amazing aspects
52m35s: of ui5 one of the many amazing aspects
52m38s: of ui5 is that it is Enterprise ready
52m41s: and what the heck does that mean that&amp;#39;s
52m43s: just nonsense
52m45s: term what it means for example is that
52m50s: multilingual
52m52s: support proper multilingual support
52m54s: including right to left and make is out
52m57s: the box cap does the same sort of thing
53m0s: gives us the same sort of Enterprise
53m4s: level magic that allows us to just go
53m8s: make this localized and the and the and
53m11s: the result of
53m14s: specifying prepending the type
53m17s: definition of an element with this
53m18s: localized
53m20s: keyword is that it generates for us
53m25s: a ton of stuff that we can sort of see
53m28s: here create view localized sap common
53m31s: countries and we&amp;#39;ve got here look book I
53m35s: sort of I was trying to
53m37s: not Point too much to this because it&amp;#39;s
53m39s: just like head explosion time not only
53m42s: do we get this country&amp;#39;s view which
53m46s: turns out to be this country&amp;#39;s entity
53m47s: set of course you know sort of equate
53m49s: views to entity set sort of in od
53m53s: data but we we also got and we saw this
53m56s: in passing we also got another entity
53m59s: typ let me collapse these things there&amp;#39;s
54m2s: entity type books there&amp;#39;s entity type
54m4s: authors entity type countries and da
54m7s: entity type countries text what the heck
54m10s: is that who said anything about entity
54m12s: type countries text we haven&amp;#39;t even even
54m16s: this is like implicit implicit and it&amp;#39;s
54m18s: implicit implicit because of this
54m20s: localized thing right does that make
54m22s: sense so I&amp;#39;m going to pause there
54m24s: because it&amp;#39;s so much in the chat is
54m26s: brilliant
54m27s: um looking at the T So Garfield says oh
54m30s: Garfield is talking to AI looking at the
54m32s: table definitions it seems it does get
54m33s: populated from cap sap common countries
54m35s: Ai and your book data CSV overrides so
54m39s: um there&amp;#39;s no I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s any
54m40s: data that comes from sap CDs common no
54m43s: data but we&amp;#39;ve supplied some data by me
54m46s: typing something putting something in
54m48s: the sap.com and- countries. CSV so going
54m51s: back to this conversation about you know
54m53s: what might we collect want ideally is
54m58s: maybe um oh oh my goodness Me Maybe um a
55m3s: plugin a c plug-in that
55m7s: supplies countries data currency data
55m10s: language data because also remember
55m12s: remember
55m13s: remember that not only do we have let&amp;#39;s
55m15s: go into there not only do we have like a
55m18s: common country type but we&amp;#39;ve got some
55m21s: common currency type currency t uh t t C
55m25s: in sap R three
55m29s: um uh language type you know these are
55m32s: all common things that are the same the
55m34s: world over but with different text
55m36s: anyway so we could imagine that not only
55m38s: might we want a package or something a
55m40s: cat plugin I don&amp;#39;t know um to supply
55m43s: data for countries currencies time zones
55m47s: languages you know all these things so
55m50s: um ah so the the underscore code going
55m55s: back to where we digress from a
55m58s: digression underscore code here where is
56m3s: it country of birth underscore
56m7s: code that underscore code is at when
56m13s: when at the persistence layer the ddl
56m16s: the data definition language here this
56m18s: this stuff is generated for us by cap
56m22s: for the persistence layer um we want
56m26s: actually want to use right now which is
56m27s: SQL light in this case so it&amp;#39;s sort of
56m28s: you know regular
56m30s: SQL we get an narr 3 but it&amp;#39;s got this
56m34s: underscore code because it knows it
56m36s: needs to maintain this foreign key
56m39s: relationship between the Bookshop author
56m42s: table and the sap common countries table
56m47s: so this country of birth underscore code
56m50s: here sort of relates
56m52s: to the values that go in here here code
56m55s: uncore code if that if that name there
56m58s: was banana that would be country of
57m0s: birth uncore
57m1s: banana okay so code is not you know a
57m5s: magic word it&amp;#39;s basically underscore the
57m7s: name of the key field primary key code
57m10s: in the in the entity in the table to
57m13s: which it
57m14s: refers carfield or select from t00 5T
57m17s: brilliant brilliant t006 why am I
57m20s: thinking of t006 is that is that
57m22s: currencies no T C currencies it&amp;#39;s a long
57m25s: time since I&amp;#39;ve dug around in the ABAB
57m26s: stack t006 somebody put tell me what
57m29s: t006 is is driving me mad um do you see
57m33s: the flexible programing model says
57m34s: Raphael becoming more popular or even
57m36s: the best practice in the
57m40s: future what is the famous uh famous
57m45s: um Danish physicist Neils bore say
57m49s: prediction is difficult especially of
57m52s: the future so I don&amp;#39;t know I mean I
57m55s: think I think both um Fury elements
57m58s: based uh UI um tooling is going to be
58m3s: continue to be super popular but also
58m5s: the flexible programming model as a sort
58m6s: of a you know not an alternative but as
58m8s: a complimentary uh approach absolutely
58m11s: absolutely so um Anan says head
58m14s: explosion thanks uh or from I
58m18s: think I think we I think we should stop
58m21s: here I mean it&amp;#39;s a bit of a bit of a
58m24s: another cliffhanger
58m26s: let&amp;#39;s just let&amp;#39;s just think where we are
58m28s: got two more minutes left uh so chak
58m30s: chanaka any reason why the views are
58m33s: generates are generated any advantage
58m36s: behind those views implicitly well
58m39s: yes that&amp;#39;s a great question to end on
58m41s: and we&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll answer it very
58m45s: briefly okay if I were to say if I think
58m49s: I understand the question why so I&amp;#39;m
58m51s: going to interpret the question as why
58m53s: are there views as well as tables right
58m56s: think in general as of views as being
59m0s: the things that sort of translate into
59m3s: the entities
59m5s: types in od data and of course this is
59m8s: you know cap is more about oata but odor
59m10s: is you know the most common thing for us
59m12s: oh unit of measure thank you Anan unit
59m14s: of measure I knew it was a common thing
59m16s: and
59m18s: you if we were to say
59m20s: service banana right and then we also
59m24s: had entity something as
59m27s: projection on
59m30s: Bookshop do
59m33s: books um oh we got his title right uh
59m38s: title there now what
59m42s: happens here let me just move that down
59m44s: a bit there so all I&amp;#39;m doing is I&amp;#39;m
59m47s: defining a second service with an entity
59m49s: so if I say here CDs compile to SQL
59m52s: Services uh where is it now um
59m55s: create view uh Bookshop books Bookshop
59m59s: books common countries where is it where
60m1s: is it where is it where is it where is
60m2s: it where is it I should do a search
60m4s: really localize views localized de we
60m7s: look we&amp;#39;ll look at what
60m9s: this uh service tell you what CDs watch
60m13s: this might be easier to
60m15s: see CDs watch come on come on come
60m19s: on go
60m22s: back there something so this something
60m25s: oh there we go I&amp;#39;ve not deployed it
60m27s: right remember we have to deploy when we
60m28s: change the CDs that was that was also
60m30s: the answer why we didn&amp;#39;t get the data in
60m32s: the countries even what we put the book
60m34s: the data in the csvs so basically think
60m37s: of the views as the more natural way to
60m41s: express
60m43s: projections which are
60m45s: essentially the most common way of
60m48s: defining entities at the service level
60m50s: we&amp;#39;ll dig into that next time hopefully
60m51s: that sort of answers your question a
60m52s: little bit we&amp;#39;re over time now so thanks
60m54s: so much for watching I&amp;#39;m here around
60m55s: next week so we&amp;#39;ll see you next week and
60m56s: we&amp;#39;ll dig in more and hopefully then
60m59s: exit the warehouse and start to use the
61m1s: associations with implicit cardinality
61m3s: to define a relationship between books
61m5s: and authors thanks very much uh yeah
61m8s: okay brilliant head explosion hopefully
61m9s: that was okay let me know in the chat
61m11s: whether that was okay thank you very
61m13s: much bye for
61m23s: now
